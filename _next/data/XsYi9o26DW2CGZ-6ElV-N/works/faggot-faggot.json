I met Jason in '94 when MULTIPLE CHOICE and his band RESIN opened for TOTAL CHAOS in Mankato and I met the Profane Punks for the first time. I met Saira in '98 when ARTIMUS PYLE played with DETESTATION at the Wasted In The Woods festival in Tenino, Washington. And then sometime in the mid '00s they were in Minneapolis....and there was FAGGOT.  You can dismiss them as a schtick if you want, and you'd be forgiven because the name and the song titles bend the needle towards gimmick....but listen. The subject matter is real, the compositions are advanced and FAGGOT just don't hit like. a regular band - or any band for that matter. You take this demo a few steps in another direction and you're on a whole other trip - it jams, it grooves, it's just......different. I don't think FAGGOT would give half a shit about my opinion though (then or now), but I do think that FAGGOT would be happy to know that someone is (still) listening, you know? Check the LP on Profane Existence to be sure, but check this tape and know that FAGGOT were revolutionary punks. FAGGOT\n</blockquote>\n"]},"thumbnail":[{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2fFaggot%20cover%202%20copy_thumb.jpg/full/125,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2FFaggot%20cover%202%20copy_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":125},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2fFaggot%20cover%20copy_thumb.jpg/full/145,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2FFaggot%20cover%20copy_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":145},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":276,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Faggot_Faggot%2F__ia_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":180}],"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/minnesota.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/faggot.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Faggot - Faggot - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2024/09/faggot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">September 14, 2024</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\n Look...FAGGOT were legends.

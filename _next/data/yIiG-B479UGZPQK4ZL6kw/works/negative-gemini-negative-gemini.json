NEGATIVE GEMINI release is that it's distant and....not just untouchable, but unattainable. Because it's not for you. These four songs sound wonderful this morning, there are moments that might even make you feel good (at least in a moment) and these sounds are there for you to appreciate. But you can never have them - and you can feel that distance when you listen. I could discuss the ominous dance floor sensuality of \"Ghost World\" and the repetitive \"All I Ever Wanted Was To Feel Again...\" plea that swims through the beats, but those beats have been analyzed since they appeared on Forget Your Future in 2013 (with versions of the other three songs contained here) so I'll just let you...listen. And maybe that line in “Ghost World” is actually “All I Ever Wanted Was To Feel OK” or maybe it’s both. It sounds wonderful, even if you are not. NEGATIVE GEMINI\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://neggygemmy.bandcamp.com/album/forget-your-future\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://neggygemmy.bandcamp.com/album/forget-your-future</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/virginia.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/negative-gemini.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Negative Gemini - Negative Gemini - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2024/03/negative-gemini.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 09, 2024</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\n The beauty in the first (?)

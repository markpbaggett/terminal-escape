And once again - I hear bands like RHYTHM OF CRUELTY and all I want is more. The brutal simplicity of the opening track, with the caterwauling vocals sharing reverberating frequencies with the over treated guitars and a two track monotony that continues for three and one half minutes...that simplicity can also be described as perfection. The next two are slightly more up tempo, vocals lost swimming in those guitars while the phasered (of course) bass drives the train (actually, the drum tracks might be the most interesting aspect of this whole recording, but they are sadly buried in the mix...if only they had an effects pedal for drums - oh wait: it's a drums machine, so they've got that covered too). By the time \"Still Life\" settles into a 4/4 to close things out, you might be as addicted as I was. Lucky you, because this tape is from 2012, and this Canadian duo has been rather busy since then.\nSTILL LIFE\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://rhythmofcruelty.bandcamp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://rhythmofcruelty.bandcamp.com/</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/goth-punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/rhythm-of-cruelty.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Rhythm Of Cruelty - Still Life - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2016/02/rhythm-of-cruelty.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 01, 2016</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nOnce again - I'm getting tired of the hoards of kids dishing out regurgitations of the new wave and goth that a sunk into as a teen.

So, yeah....I mean, we all have regrets. Anyway, this day is traditionally commemorated by overeating and watching sports, most notably a sport called \"football,\" which is somehow different from the most popular organized sport in the world, which is also called football. But it's good to have alternate plans, and today I suggest three North American punk rock acts, all contributors to the \"Do It Yourself\" subculture through varying eras and decades and scenes, all worthy of attention, and all stupid enough to release one song demonstration cassettes.

Fair? Fair. EYE JAMMY was one of the coolest bands I saw at this year's Everything Is Not OK festival, and the crew that they rolled in with certainly didn't hurt their casual claims of baller status (note to touring bands: always roll with a dozen rockers who know all all of your songs and can sing all of the choruses and dance their asses off - locals will think you are bad ass, and you will therefore feel and play like bad asses, it's a glorious cycle). I guess there's another song meant to be on this tape, but with a track as siq as \"Nuklear Beach\" I kinda don't even fukkn care...and also they are from Mississippi. \nFUCKBOYZ // SUNSET BEACH // EYE JAMMY\nThanks.....you are welcome. \n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8LDqCj8GvEo/WhTxq_McswI/AAAAAAAASC4/5zSdt88_mOsaSGOqXnwgqX671m1r5duTwCLcBGAs/s1600/FBoyz%2BErrol%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8LDqCj8GvEo/WhTxq_McswI/AAAAAAAASC4/5zSdt88_mOsaSGOqXnwgqX671m1r5duTwCLcBGAs/s1600/FBoyz%2BErrol%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLAfgynBqLs/WhTyj0Ru9-I/AAAAAAAASDA/i4jAe9-Vg8U54cz3gEuzJ1XBbryNzfB-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Sunset%2BBeach%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lLAfgynBqLs/WhTyj0Ru9-I/AAAAAAAASDA/i4jAe9-Vg8U54cz3gEuzJ1XBbryNzfB-ACLcBGAs/s1600/Sunset%2BBeach%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"YOU'RE WELCOME - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2017/11/youre-welcome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">November 23, 2017</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nIn The United States of America, many (most, in fact) will celebrate a thing called \"Thanksgiving.\" What it is that they (we, in this case) are \"celebrating\" is a subject of much debate, but the line The Man has fed us for generations is that this day commemorates the Native Americans and/or First Nations peoples showing a bunch of dumb ass Europeans how to cook and hunt and shit, saving said dumb ass Europeans from certain death.

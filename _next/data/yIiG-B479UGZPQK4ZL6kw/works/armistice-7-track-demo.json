And when someone tells me about a punk band from Wales who recorded only one batch of songs in 1981, I get fukkn excited. They don't need to be the best songs I've ever heard....because they are new songs and I'm hearing them for the first time. And maybe \"Do We Need This\" is barely listenable on this tape and maybe \"Fight For Freedom\" isn't even on here at all but holding a piece of 40 year old punk is still cool as shit. All of the cuts here have appeared on compilations, though mostly not until the Bullsheep Detector series on AntiSociety came out in the '10s. No enough can be said about a band who can (successfully) make a so-called song out of a primitive assemblage of rackets like \"Conservate & Liberate,\" but ARMISTICE is reall all about \"Anarchy\" on repeat all day every day....trust me. ARMISTICE\n</blockquote>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/uk-punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/armistice.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Armistice - 7 track demo - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2021/03/armistice.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 28, 2021</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\n Why the continued fascination with \"old\" punk?

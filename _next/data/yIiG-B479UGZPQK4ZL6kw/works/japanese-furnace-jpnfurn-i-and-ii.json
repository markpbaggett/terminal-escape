I challenge you to make aggressive music sounds this genuinely damaged. The mix is all fukkd up, the components all sound like they were recorded in a basement toilet on a micro-cassette recorded and nothing sounds like it is even supposed to go together. I can't tell if the vocalist is mad at the world or just pissed because the bass guitar is smothered weird sauce and all you can really hear is the unfortunate off time click instead of the low end rumble that might give the recording some power. There are breakdowns....and those are a different story. A story about how JAPANESE FURNACE just doesn't make sense. I mean, it's hardcore to be sure, but I don't think you can set out to make something this demented, and I certainly cannot imagine a band hearing this mix after a recording and thinking \"Yeah, sure....that's what we were going for. Let's release it!\" It should go without saying that this band is fukkn great. Two demos, from 2013 and 2014, repackaged for further listening confusion and/or pleasure....the second one sounds slightly more cohesive, is no less intense, and the guitar solo in \"Dried Out\" is just...wow.  \nJPNFURN: I & II\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QQH5VXbUEZ0/XJDyXB8vAfI/AAAAAAAAU5g/KIZaQrbzyS8OKJK9o6_BKNo4-NK6nfH3gCEwYBhgL/s1600/Japanese%2BFurnace%2Binside%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QQH5VXbUEZ0/XJDyXB8vAfI/AAAAAAAAU5g/KIZaQrbzyS8OKJK9o6_BKNo4-NK6nfH3gCEwYBhgL/s1600/Japanese%2BFurnace%2Binside%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/hardcore.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/japanese-furnace.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Japanese Furnace - JPNFURN: I & II - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2019/03/japanese-furnace.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">March 19, 2019</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nDisgusting.

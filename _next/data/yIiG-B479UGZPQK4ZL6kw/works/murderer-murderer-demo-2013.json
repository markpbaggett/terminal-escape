MURDERER sound like walking down the street late at night with purpose, perhaps with trouble on their minds or perhaps just trying to survive. These are the sounds coming from behind the door in the dank alley...the sounds that compel you to open the door even though you are kinda scared about the scene waiting for you on the other side. It's a room filled with punks, punks with chains and safety pins pogoing their asses off and spilling beer with abandon like it was the blood of the vanquished. It looks reckless.

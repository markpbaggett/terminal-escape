Imagine that knob is a hand on your throat in darkness. Imagine that knob is life. Your life. Imagine that life (your life) is a grip on your windpipe that grows stronger as the sound increases. Imagine increasing the volume and increasing the intensity, and the physical nothingness that surrounds you starts to give space to the ethereal darkness that inhabits you. Breath giving way to a physical silence until the only thing left in this moment is the deafening sound of your struggle. The life that has (always) crushed you metaphorically manifests as that hand on your throat, and you control the knob (or button, or key...you control the key) - you control the flow of sound. The flow of air. And the volume increases. You increase the volume and you suffocate. And then it's over. You are released and you can breathe...and you look at the symbol like the head of an arrow pointing to the right as you feel your heart working harder to return you to a normal but you can still feel the sound linger. You can still feel that hand lingering...your hand lingering. And you look at that head of an arrow and you think: \"Just seven minutes...I can do it again. I am strong.\" And you you press play.

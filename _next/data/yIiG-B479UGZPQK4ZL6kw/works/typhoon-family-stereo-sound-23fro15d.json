I don't know where it came from, and honestly I don't even know how to describe it. This shit hits like '90s college radio and Japanese indie and '00s heavy alt all trying to figure out who's gonna buy the next round and.....I'm still not sure if and/or why I like it, but I keep listening so I suggest you keep listening.

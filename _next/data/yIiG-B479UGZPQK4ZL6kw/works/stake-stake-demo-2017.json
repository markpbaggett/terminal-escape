At its roots, STAKE sound like a vaguely danceable dark punk band - but there's something special about a band when they hit you just right. I ripped this one at the very beginning of the journey into The New Reality, not knowing where the journey would lead or what the reality would be. Six weeks later....we still don't. And while I don't think the humans responsible for STAKE are prescient, somehow I feel like I will hear them on the other side.

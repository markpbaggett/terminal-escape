But it's weird as shit. The longest track on the demo, \"Transitions Into Victory,\" features the most damaged sounds coming out of a guitar while the drums and bass lay back with an early '80s Rough Trade groove and the vocals start to get a soulful swagger, but that's as close as TEENAGE WAISTBAND get to anything normal on this 2011 release...and they make sure to wipe that impression clean with the tape's closer \"Ghost In The Boombox.\" This one took be by surprise.

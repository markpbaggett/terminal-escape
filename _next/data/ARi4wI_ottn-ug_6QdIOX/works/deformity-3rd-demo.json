Here's the third demo from New York's DEFORMITY, and from the screech that opens \"Sacrifice\" you know you are are going to get treated to a non stop barrage of 4 track madness. Everything is (naturally) pegged in the red, and the mix is perfect for this style of noisy fukkd hardcore. The bass is blown out, hollow and low end heavy, while the drums are buried in a wash of white cymbal noise with a flat snare drum getting brutalized just begging to be heard. Appropriately affected vocals battle for attention with the wall of guitar noise, but the vocals lose this battle, and will likewise lose all future contests with that six stringed ear destroyer. You know the comparisons by now - CONFUSE, DISORDER and so on - but DEFORMITY take UK82 simplicity, DBeat ferocity, and a whole shitload of high end distortion and make themselves a healthy racket. Maybe Monday should be noise punk day?

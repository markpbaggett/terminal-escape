Most of the same women, this time dressed in black. This time playing with more ferocity. This time they looked evil as shit with Noto serving as an uncompromising frontwoman. This time they were serious and this was no fukkn novelty. Except that...geri means diarrhea, and all of the songs were about shit. \"White Lover.\" \"Angry Ass.\" \"Poop Swimming.\" Finally this crew had honed their craft...and they just sang about poo.

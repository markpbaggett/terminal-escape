Because even when the deck is stacked in your favor, you can still feel like the world is against you....so imagine how you would fucking feel if the world was against you? If you didn't have that leg up that you got simply because of how or where you were born, you dig? Yeah...fucking pissed. And it's good to know that a lot of other people are pissed too, no matter where (or when) they (or you) come from.

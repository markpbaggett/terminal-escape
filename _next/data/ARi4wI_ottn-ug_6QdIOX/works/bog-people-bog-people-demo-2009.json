But as soon as I mentioned this (on the VIVID SEKT/BOG PEOPLE post) the band got in touch, and mailed me these killer tunes before I could even make it home from Los Angeles - and our van goes pretty fast.  So cheers twice to BOG PEOPLE: once for making the tunes, and then again for making sure I got them.\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S7UwCaiS08I/AAAAAAAAAxQ/kcD0t5bOHQs/s1600/bog+people+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//3.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S7UwCaiS08I/AAAAAAAAAxQ/kcD0t5bOHQs/s1600/bog+people+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S7VZfv7X7yI/AAAAAAAAAxY/4fMg7fmbnnE/s1600/bog+people+inside.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/S7VZfv7X7yI/AAAAAAAAAxY/4fMg7fmbnnE/s1600/bog+people+inside.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/portland.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/bog-people.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Bog People - Bog People demo 2009 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/04/bog-people.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">April 04, 2010</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nAfter I put up the VIVID SEKT/BOG PEOPLE tour cassette last week, folks asked for the BOG PEOPLE tape...and I am happy to oblige (the tunes from the VS/BP tour split are all on the bands' respective tapes, so the split probably wasn't a necessary post, but I had just had my mind blown by both so it seemed logical).

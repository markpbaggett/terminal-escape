Not much to say that I didn't say nine years ago, just furiously fast and incredibly furious hardcore punk. \"No Lifeboats\" and \"Fate\" could have been anthems for the isolation age that kicked off this portentous decade dominated by fear and frustration, while \"I Wish I Could Help You\" closes the tape with a positively dreadful (and positively negative) dose of loss.

If I had to reduce it to one word, Germany's EX-DIEL sound determined. Fortunately I have far more latitude than that, and I can say that Germany's EX-DIEL conjure '80s ghosts as varied as Faith and Evol on a recording dominated by spoken/shouted vocals in a constant face off with an atonal, open guitar furiously bashing simplicity into the earth. The songs are plodding and deliberate missives, deliveries that tell stories with both word and sound, and I'm as drawn to this tape as I have been to anything in quite some time. Simply put, sometimes punk with no rules is the best punk. \nDEM-MASTER\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://ex-diel.bandcamp.com/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ex-diel.bandcamp.com/releases</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/germany.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/ex-diel.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Ex-Diel - s/t demo 2017 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2019/12/ex-diel.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 04, 2019</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nThis one was a breath of fresh air that rushed in amidst a horde of neanderthal hardcore stomps.

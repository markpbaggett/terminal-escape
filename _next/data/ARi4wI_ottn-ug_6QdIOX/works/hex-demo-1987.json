The UK political punk fury hasn't left the band though, \"All God's Christians\" is a two minute ripper that borders on crossover until the bridge comes in with it's melodic guitar leads (once again: THE CULT and THE ALARM are all over this thing in the guitar department). The demo closes with a quality five minute jam that is transfixing from start to finish, total MOB/ZOUNDS styled dreary UK anarcho with soaring vocals and ethereal guitars. There is virtually no edge to these songs whatsoever, and if I had a complaint that would certainly be it, but I grew up a new waver, and these layers of decidedly untough vocal melodies are suiting me just fine this morning.\nHEX - 1987 DEMO\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TGFlG-ecHCI/AAAAAAAABKo/56aB8JsgRBk/s1600/hex+1987+demo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//3.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TGFlG-ecHCI/AAAAAAAABKo/56aB8JsgRBk/s1600/hex+1987+demo.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/terminal-escape.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":" - Hex demo 1987 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/08/hex-1987.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">August 10, 2010</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nAfter Poison In The System and Not The Promised Land, HEX cranked out this gem of a demo that brought together all of the elements they had been toying with on the earlier demos.

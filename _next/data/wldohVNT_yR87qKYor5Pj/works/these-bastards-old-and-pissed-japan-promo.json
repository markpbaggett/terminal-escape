The demo was good, and while you always kinda hope that a band progresses after their first recording - THESE BASTARDS went straight steamroller on the tracks, and the recording is full and filthy. Relevant brutality from some serious OGs - members of MORBID LIFE SOCIETY, SLOBBER, VENKMAN, AGENTS OF SATAN....if you get it, then you get it. Choice cut: \"Red Snake Whip.\"\n OLD AND PISSED\nReleased as a 12 minute EP, but a choice few copies got crammed in plastic cassette shells to pass out to folks in Japan while Stoney was on vacation.  \n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://thesebastards.bandcamp.com/music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thesebastards.bandcamp.com/music</a>\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/these-bastards-old-and-pissed-japan-promo","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/These-Bastards_Old-And-Pissed---Japan-promo%2fThese%20Bastards%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":192,"height":124,"alt":"These Bastards -

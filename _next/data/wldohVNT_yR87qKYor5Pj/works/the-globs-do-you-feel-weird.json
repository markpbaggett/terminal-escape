The Colony in Sacramento with ASTRAL BUTCHER, RISE & STRIKE and COLD TRAP tonight), and fate has clearly done us all right. This could be Sac in 200? (THE FOUR EYES, BANANAS) delivering more irreverent and shamelessly catchy drugged out garage punk, but THE GLOBS also harness some real alien shit on their 2016 debut. Throw in a serious but seriously understated penchant for psychedelics and you're holding a dangerous thing in your hand. Like, the demo is titled Do You Feel Weird? and it seems like they are asking if you are truly aware of the spiritual effect the sounds had on you while you were listening....because they know damn well what they've done. WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN and/or TURN-UPS caliber addictiveness here, plus a mini '70s Sac drug rock sampler on the flip side (crucial banger 45s from TWINKEYZ, OZZIE, and one more I can't place) so you've been warned. \nDO YOU FEEL WEIRD?\nAnyone who brings a copy of the OZZIE \"Android Love\" 45 to The Colony tonight can have all the guest list spots they want...assuming the copy is for me to keep. \n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODQrxwVX10c/XkIki_6CgJI/AAAAAAAAWns/0HcX9IpZEmw9E6yZd3ivEiLLT84MKWrUgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Globs%2Btape%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODQrxwVX10c/XkIki_6CgJI/AAAAAAAAWns/0HcX9IpZEmw9E6yZd3ivEiLLT84MKWrUgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Globs%2Btape%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n"]},"thumbnail":[{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/126,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2FGlobs%20cover_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":126},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20img_thumb.jpg/full/185,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2FGlobs%20img_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":185},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":128,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20outside_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2FGlobs%20outside_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":118,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20tape%20img%20copy_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2FGlobs%20tape%20img%20copy_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":117,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20tape%20img_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2FGlobs%20tape%20img_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":275,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2F__ia_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":180}],"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/psychedelic.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/the-globs.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"The Globs - Do You Feel Weird? - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-globs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">February 14, 2020</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nWe can probably thank fate for guiding me to this one today without even remembering that THE GLOBS were from Sacramento (SHIT COFFINS play The Colony in Sacramento with ASTRAL BUTCHER, RISE & STRIKE and COLD TRAP tonight), and fate has clearly done us all right.

Throw in a serious but seriously understated penchant for psychedelics and you're holding a dangerous thing in your hand. Like, the demo is titled Do You Feel Weird? and it seems like they are asking if you are truly aware of the spiritual effect the sounds had on you while you were listening....because they know damn well what they've done. WHITE TRASH SUPERMAN and/or TURN-UPS caliber addictiveness here, plus a mini '70s Sac drug rock sampler on the flip side (crucial banger 45s from TWINKEYZ, OZZIE, and one more I can't place) so you've been warned. \nDO YOU FEEL WEIRD?\nAnyone who brings a copy of the OZZIE \"Android Love\" 45 to The Colony tonight can have all the guest list spots they want...assuming the copy is for me to keep. \n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODQrxwVX10c/XkIki_6CgJI/AAAAAAAAWns/0HcX9IpZEmw9E6yZd3ivEiLLT84MKWrUgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Globs%2Btape%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ODQrxwVX10c/XkIki_6CgJI/AAAAAAAAWns/0HcX9IpZEmw9E6yZd3ivEiLLT84MKWrUgCEwYBhgL/s1600/Globs%2Btape%2Bimg%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/the-globs-do-you-feel-weird","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Globs_Do-You-Feel-Weird%2fGlobs%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/126,/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":126,"height":192,"alt":"The Globs -

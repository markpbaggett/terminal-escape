2014</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nOne of my bands played with THE GAIA in San Francisco in 199(5?), and while they supremely kicked our asses, I don't think I really grasped their importance or potential impact until they organized our Tokyo shows in 1996 (they picked up up at the train station and told us we had to hurry...it was very confusing...and before we knew it we were watching SHIKBANE and the final performance from SINK - good thing we hurried). Musically, they crank out \"traditional\" Japanese hardcore with jaw dropping vocals and riffs that stand up brilliantly when compared to contemporaries like DEATH SIDE and BASTARD, even though THE GAIA isn't as heavy as the latter and perhaps doesn't shred as much as the former (though this is debatable). These demos do more than just hold up, their rock 'n roll bent (especially on tracks like \"Boys\" and \"Dream Machine\" from the '93 demo) along with the non-stop gallop that commands the airing of fists set THE GAIA apart. You can address their gender if you like, and many do, but it's the content that really kicks up ass.\nTHE GAIA\nThis DL contains THE GAIA demos from 1990, 1993 and 1994. Their Kick Up Ass and This One full lengths are mandatory listening for Japanese HC fans, as well as the No. 1 EP and the split with DEAD AND GONE. I almost forgot how fukkn good this band was...\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-JijTpTbhGpM/U4P3ateo8lI/AAAAAAAAKBw/lmexf0_Y_48/s1600/gaia+90+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//4.bp.blogspot.com/-JijTpTbhGpM/U4P3ateo8lI/AAAAAAAAKBw/lmexf0_Y_48/s1600/gaia+90+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-qZf5bZzBxO0/U4P6vdjGH_I/AAAAAAAAKB8/tj9zM6QKPP0/s1600/gaia+93+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//2.bp.blogspot.com/-qZf5bZzBxO0/U4P6vdjGH_I/AAAAAAAAKB8/tj9zM6QKPP0/s1600/gaia+93+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-UjJv83UXceE/U4P61aZIjyI/AAAAAAAAKCE/rUd1Syf5SE4/s1600/gaia+94+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//3.bp.blogspot.com/-UjJv83UXceE/U4P61aZIjyI/AAAAAAAAKCE/rUd1Syf5SE4/s1600/gaia+94+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-h_wxs1ZEtTI/U4P8LGveBKI/AAAAAAAAKCQ/KlXl7WqZBX4/s1600/gaia+spine.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//4.bp.blogspot.com/-h_wxs1ZEtTI/U4P8LGveBKI/AAAAAAAAKCQ/KlXl7WqZBX4/s1600/gaia+spine.jpg</a>\n"]},"thumbnail":[{"format":"image/jpeg","height":268,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2F__ia_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":180},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%201994_thumb.jpg/full/129,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%201994_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":129},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":192,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%2090%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/125,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%2090%20cover_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":125},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":117,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%2090%20outside_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%2090%20outside_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":124,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%2093%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%2093%20cover_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":180,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%2093%20outside_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%2093%20outside_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":122,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%2094%20cover_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%2094%20cover_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":22,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2fgaia%20spine_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Gaia_The-Gaia-demo-1990%2Fgaia%20spine_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192}],"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/the-gaia.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"The Gaia - The Gaia demo 1990 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-gaia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">May 27, 2014</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nOne of my bands played with THE GAIA in San Francisco in 199(5?), and while they supremely kicked our asses, I don't think I really grasped their importance or potential impact until they organized our Tokyo shows in 1996 (they picked up up at the train station and told us we had to hurry...it was very confusing...and before we knew it we were watching SHIKBANE and the final performance from SINK - good thing we hurried). Musically, they crank out \"traditional\" Japanese hardcore with jaw dropping vocals and riffs that stand up brilliantly when compared to contemporaries like DEATH SIDE and BASTARD, even though THE GAIA isn't as heavy as the latter and perhaps doesn't shred as much as the former (though this is debatable). These demos do more than just hold up, their rock 'n roll bent (especially on tracks like \"Boys\" and \"Dream Machine\" from the '93 demo) along with the non-stop gallop that commands the airing of fists set THE GAIA apart. You can address their gender if you like, and many do, but it's the content that really kicks up ass.\nTHE GAIA\nThis DL contains THE GAIA demos from 1990, 1993 and 1994. Their Kick Up Ass and This One full lengths are mandatory listening for Japanese HC fans, as well as the No. 1 EP and the split with DEAD AND GONE.

gloriously primitive state. Reinterpreting US punk and hardcore/thrash crossover through Japanese ears, these kids rip through ten killers on their ridiculously limited demo (is 20 copies really a demo? I think it's more of a gift for your friends, 'cause no one else is gonna hear that shit). It's funny to think of OUT OF TOUCH as kids, but in a Japanese scene dominated by DEMOLITION, RUSTLER, ZONE, NIGHTMARE and DEATHSIDE, OUT OF TOUCH were certainly the newcomers. 18 years after this demo was recorded, the singer served me a delicious vegan picnic in the rain not far from the Nagoya train station...Hidehito is a very nice man.\nOUT OF TOUCH\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQByvIBl9EI/AAAAAAAABbI/Jbgxf5BB4iw/s1600/out+of+touch+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQByvIBl9EI/AAAAAAAABbI/Jbgxf5BB4iw/s1600/out+of+touch+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQB3HjfgmGI/AAAAAAAABbM/NhMPbS_SHPI/s1600/out+if+touch+img%2527.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQB3HjfgmGI/AAAAAAAABbM/NhMPbS_SHPI/s1600/out+if+touch+img%2527.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/japanese-hardcore.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/out-of-touch.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Out Of Touch - Out Of Touch demo 1991 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/12/out-of-touch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 09, 2010</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nNagoya's OUT OF TOUCH predated the wave of retro punk/thrash worship by a solid decade, and this 1991 demo shows them in their most gloriously primitive state. Reinterpreting US punk and hardcore/thrash crossover through Japanese ears, these kids rip through ten killers on their ridiculously limited demo (is 20 copies really a demo?

It's funny to think of OUT OF TOUCH as kids, but in a Japanese scene dominated by DEMOLITION, RUSTLER, ZONE, NIGHTMARE and DEATHSIDE, OUT OF TOUCH were certainly the newcomers. 18 years after this demo was recorded, the singer served me a delicious vegan picnic in the rain not far from the Nagoya train station...Hidehito is a very nice man.\nOUT OF TOUCH\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQByvIBl9EI/AAAAAAAABbI/Jbgxf5BB4iw/s1600/out+of+touch+cover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQByvIBl9EI/AAAAAAAABbI/Jbgxf5BB4iw/s1600/out+of+touch+cover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQB3HjfgmGI/AAAAAAAABbM/NhMPbS_SHPI/s1600/out+if+touch+img%2527.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//4.bp.blogspot.com/_UWPI3C1CSoU/TQB3HjfgmGI/AAAAAAAABbM/NhMPbS_SHPI/s1600/out+if+touch+img%2527.jpg</a>\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/out-of-touch-out-of-touch-demo-1991","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"/images/image.svg","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"alt":"Fallback Image Indicating Manifest is Missing a Thumbnail"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Flex, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Flex) _missingMdxReference(\"Flex\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Share) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Share\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsx(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: _jsxs(Flex, {\n          gap: \"7\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Box, {\n            children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n              size: \"8\",\n              mb: \"5\"\n            }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n              size: \"4\",\n              color: \"gray\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsx(Work.Share, {})]\n        })\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ?

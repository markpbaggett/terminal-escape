It was a ripper - PERMANENT RUIN played and they were at their most fierce. C.R.A.S.H. jumped on the show (and played first, in case you ever wanted to check the legitimate humility of a James Beard Award winning chef in action). The short lived freak show COPS, and REPLICA was straight fire. Every band was shit hot and the crowd was awesome...it was one of those affirming nights that remind you exactly how awesome this punk thing can really be. RAD hadn't really been down to SF/Oakland much, we all knew how ripping they were, but it was the first introduction for a lot of people at the show. There was one lanky longhair wilding out in the pit during their set; dude was having a fukkn time, but he was kinda harshing the mellow of some of the people in attendance...a bump here, a slam there, maybe he was wearing a NIRVANA shirt or some shit, and people were starting to give him mean mugs. And then RAD vocalist Lori, perhaps because she is awesome or perhaps because she sensed the vibe tide turning, took a moment between songs to introduce the rager to everyone at the show. \"Hey!! This is **Tom. He came down with us from Sacramento and he's having a really really good time - hopefully you can all have a good time with him!\" (or something to that effect). And instantly, the vibe changed. **Tom was now the fukkn center of the party, and the energy level of the room leapt off the scale as everyone (and seemingly, it was everyone) was in the mix with **Tom leading the charge. Things stayed amazing after RAD played, maybe they even got better, but I still credit Lori and RAD with making sure that night started great and stayed great, and it was one of my favorite NO STATIK shows. \nSICK BURN\nSICK BURN are three of the four people in RAD, and they play like they never missed a beat. These people are, in all honesty, fukkn RAD.  Eight songs in as many minutes, blending brilliance and irreverence with high energy thrash 'n roll. Think early '00s acts like RAZORS EDGE, but with just enough California sprinkled on top.

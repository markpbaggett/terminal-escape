The transfer is admittedly not the best (tapes, motherfukkr!), but there are some nice rougher versions of some cuts that would appear on the Sweet Life LP, plus \"Survival Of The Meek\" is a total slammer and doesn't seem to pop up anywhere else. GOD - 1987 DEMO\n</blockquote>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/terminal-escape.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/god-holland.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"God (Holland) - Demo 1987 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2022/12/god.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 20, 2022</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nBy the late '80s, you had folks who felt like punk (and specifically hardcore) was just completely dead and you had folks who had just moved on and you had folks who were being introduced to new punk-adjacent (or punk influenced) bands without even knowing about the sonic roots.

Released at the start of 2018, Negative Highlight Reel is among the more advanced of Repulski's 20+ releases - drum machine pop hides behind a shroud of experimental aural assemblages, a series of collages that blur the lines between presentations and/or actualities. The recording closes with a proto-raga that barely holds after the brief Ranaldo/Shields/Rev-esque wash of \"Kimp Notch\" fades away, and it leaves me with a yearning for more that I have rarely experienced - I was anxious that it was over because it was all gone too soon.

The fifteen tracks here take up just over half an hour and run the spectrum, filling genre defying holes as they veer in and out of compartmentalized punk and making this a wholly listenable and engaging cassette in the process.  I can only imagine that there are (or could have been?) countless more hours of this creative manifestation, but it appears that this untitled (unreleased?) demo and a split EP with PUS are the only physical documents available for public consumption.

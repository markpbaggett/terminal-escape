This is as close to perfect as you'll find on the internet...or anywhere else for that matter. Listen to the breakdown on \"Breaking Through\" (dude, when that breakdown falls right back into the rage....? It's magic) and you'll think I'm right. And then you'll listen to \"No Capitulation\" and you will break shit. Seriously, shit will be broken.\nPRESSING ON\n  I look around, and I don't know what to say // overwhelmed by all the bullshit that's headed our way // the future may look dim, but I know one thing is true // I'm gonna rise above this shit if it's the last fucking thing I do\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-V5EO9kVHQPI/Vaig725fLMI/AAAAAAAAMxw/xKAP4NsITZA/s1600/pressing%2Bon%2Bcover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/-V5EO9kVHQPI/Vaig725fLMI/AAAAAAAAMxw/xKAP4NsITZA/s1600/pressing%2Bon%2Bcover.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-bEDAozFcZ6g/Vaii6TdD4QI/AAAAAAAAMx8/nhn1b3cJvw4/s1600/pressing%2Bon%2B1.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//3.bp.blogspot.com/-bEDAozFcZ6g/Vaii6TdD4QI/AAAAAAAAMx8/nhn1b3cJvw4/s1600/pressing%2Bon%2B1.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-T0Xg1JB395Q/VaijAivuhtI/AAAAAAAAMyE/4Up7U07O2AY/s1600/pressing%2Bon2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//2.bp.blogspot.com/-T0Xg1JB395Q/VaijAivuhtI/AAAAAAAAMyE/4Up7U07O2AY/s1600/pressing%2Bon2.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/pdx-punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/pressing-on.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Pressing On - Pressing On demo 2015 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2015/07/pressing-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">July 17, 2015</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nStraight up: this is the best demo I've heard in I don't know how long.

And when you're setting up in a sweltering warehouse to play for a cowd of maybe half a dozen people...? Doom gets real real hard. That was the scenario facing Tijuana's ABYSSAL afew weeks ago in Fresno, and I was one of the \"maybe half a dozen\" in attendance. They got their shit dialed in and calmly announced 'We're going to play one long song for you\" and then embarked on an absolutely epic journey of sound. You could hear a pin drop in that warehouse during the introduction...and then came the tonnage. This is the hard part - because doom is (to a large extent a formula) and the audience often knows what's coming, the artist needs to surprise the listener with the how more than the what. And when ABYSSAL got heavy that night, we weren't surprised as much as we were completely blown away. It was hot, the room was awkward, and the band was mesmerizing....doom might be hard, but that night it was as if there was nothing else in this world more important than doom. It was perfect, and listening to A Deep Sea Funeral will always take me back there. A DEEP SEA FUNERAL\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://abyssaltj.bandcamp.com/music\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://abyssaltj.bandcamp.com/music</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/doom.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"ABYSSAL-Deep_Sea - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2024/07/abyssal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">July 25, 2024</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\n Doom is hard y'all.

They sounded like a complete mess. And I wish I had tried to pull that card. And these eight minutes is all that is left. Four women. No guitars. Weird and uncomfortable post punk presented as noise punk....yeah, I really wish I had tried to jump the line that night. \"We Want Anarchy\" is fukkn primal, there's just no other way to describe it. It's not \"good\" buy any classical definition, but it's more \"real\" than most of the bullshit that passes as punk in these modern days. Keep it weird, y'all.

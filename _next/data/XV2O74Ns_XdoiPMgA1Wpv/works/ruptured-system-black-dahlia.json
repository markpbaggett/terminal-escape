rel=\"nofollow\">October 09, 2021</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nA disgustingly dark collection of stench from 1990s Oklahoma, BLACK DAHLIA released but one EP in their short existence, while RUPTURED SYSTEM's tracks never had any kind of public exposure at all (until now). Pretty sure that these kids had a few EL DOPA records between them, and the desperate nihilism translated well to the sometimes bleak reality in the middle of the country. I talked to Ross a fair bit about this tape and these bands yesterday - it was a fucking magic time when everything was possible perhaps because nothing was possible. He told me that Zach and Ron (who each played in both bands on this tape) died together in a brutal car accident in 2000...losing friends is never easy, but it's so much harder when your scene is this small and interconnected. So listen at maximum volume and appreciate what you've got.  RUPTURED SYSTEM // BLACK DAHLIA\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhR_AvT1YwyzYc_U_Ci3ylspWDU41A8ZOwKKd_ZGq_u05uaAkOWC7cXawc1XL-IKspx6TLxFRffS8PVKovGovnTsyevwLrj4f62sC1WWScoMOH8P63kaT4B6DakJk-9ix_bcTqLhc5nocY8Jn_rqQ0zig2XfuWcNR-sO_9zFMFeDcHgt2vGoIP9j1VlMA=s796\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhR_AvT1YwyzYc_U_Ci3ylspWDU41A8ZOwKKd_ZGq_u05uaAkOWC7cXawc1XL-IKspx6TLxFRffS8PVKovGovnTsyevwLrj4f62sC1WWScoMOH8P63kaT4B6DakJk-9ix_bcTqLhc5nocY8Jn_rqQ0zig2XfuWcNR-sO_9zFMFeDcHgt2vGoIP9j1VlMA=s796</a>\n<a href=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjHMWGl6MvaO_DROpJaN_pwaRrcc9kxPmLcrohGoTUQNqUoM4h16ELjfX2bPZPq54fnWA5_NBsDXf73-qLN0vmSNJSwhHVIEtcosaawYaRhotQZFcwtzfL50f8Yi2SHqZRRf70s1yIrPqNpqwR85ml3tlTHVzYmgLuNofCY_FrweM_CwUgnAzfbTHE9nQ=s398\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjHMWGl6MvaO_DROpJaN_pwaRrcc9kxPmLcrohGoTUQNqUoM4h16ELjfX2bPZPq54fnWA5_NBsDXf73-qLN0vmSNJSwhHVIEtcosaawYaRhotQZFcwtzfL50f8Yi2SHqZRRf70s1yIrPqNpqwR85ml3tlTHVzYmgLuNofCY_FrweM_CwUgnAzfbTHE9nQ=s398</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/oklahoma.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"RUPTURED SYSTEM // BLACK DAHLIA - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2021/10/ruptured-system-black-dahlia.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">October 09, 2021</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nA disgustingly dark collection of stench from 1990s Oklahoma, BLACK DAHLIA released but one EP in their short existence, while RUPTURED SYSTEM's tracks never had any kind of public exposure at all (until now). Pretty sure that these kids had a few EL DOPA records between them, and the desperate nihilism translated well to the sometimes bleak reality in the middle of the country. I talked to Ross a fair bit about this tape and these bands yesterday - it was a fucking magic time when everything was possible perhaps because nothing was possible.

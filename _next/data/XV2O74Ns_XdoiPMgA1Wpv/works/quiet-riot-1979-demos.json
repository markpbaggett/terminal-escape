Rhoads is prominent on this recording, laying down screaming leads and more swagger than on his later (and far more famous)\nwork. Several generations old, the tape shows some wear, especially on Rhoads' six plus minute live solo near the end, but you don't have to have a QUIET RIOT tattoo to get into the alcohol soaked party vibe...it does help though.\n1979 DEMO + 1978 LIVE\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-4_U1eURNdks/Tu7lEVIGvWI/AAAAAAAACLE/wDIYmntsZsk/s1600/quiet+riot++copy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/-4_U1eURNdks/Tu7lEVIGvWI/AAAAAAAACLE/wDIYmntsZsk/s1600/quiet+riot++copy.jpg</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/metal.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/quiet-riot.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Quiet Riot - 1979 demos - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2011/12/quiet-riot.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 25, 2011</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nI am a shameless fan, have the tattoo to prove it, and these 1979 demos are QUIET RIOT's original lineup cranking through proto-Sunset Strip glam rock before they became radio friendly heavy metal.

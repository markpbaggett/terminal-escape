Not exactly the most original name, although I could only find one other band Called Hex (from Italy, old), and one label with the name (Pacific Northwest, current).

Like a lot of 80s UK shits, I think that this was probably a few years late at the time, but a quarter century later, this straightforward moody four chord punk suits me just fucking fine thank you. It's not all \"generic\" by any means, \"Food To Conclude\" could be an attempt at a Worlds Apart era SUBHUMANS track, and the killer \"Join Hands\" is mid tempo and dark with guitars drenched in reverb. \"No To The Bomb\" is a more basic four chord rager, which is nice, as I happen to enjoy a nice four chord rager. Four tunes here, no information on the band, except that it's made up of Pikey, Golly, Cubby and Lainy, which might be the untoughest sounding bunch of blokes I've ever come across.

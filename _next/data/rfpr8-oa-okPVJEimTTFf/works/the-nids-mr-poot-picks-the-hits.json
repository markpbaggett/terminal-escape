Sixteen songs from 1989, and the more I listen the more I like what I hear - lead guitar is ugly (and way too loud in the mix), lyrics are irreverent and kinda dorky, a through line between NEGATIVE TREND, SoCal skate rock CELIBATE RIFLES. Yeah...I keep listening, and it keeps getting better. So let's go, nerds - you tell me about this shit. Maybe everyone else already knows and I just arrived late to the party without an invitation. THE N*IDS? THE NOIDS? MR.

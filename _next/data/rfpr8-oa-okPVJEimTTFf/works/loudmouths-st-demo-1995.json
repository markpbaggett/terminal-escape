To my small town, small time ass they were fierce and wild and punk as shit - not like the spikes and studs punk, but the don't give a FUCK punks, the kind that is way more punk than the spikes and studs kind. I saw them I don't even know how many times after I moved here, and I always thought that if \"garage rock\" actually meant this, then I would be a garage rocker for life, because the shows were sweaty and off the damn rails every time. And as good as the shows were, I was pleased to (re)learn that this 25+ year old demo tape swings hard and rocks even harder. THE LOUDMOUTHSI ran into Beth at a packed noise show in the Mojave a couple of years ago. I was sitting at the bar between bands and she was buying drinks for her crew.

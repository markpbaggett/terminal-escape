The last time I saw PUNCH IN THE FACE was in 2007 - it was the last show ARTIMUS PYLE played (honestly, this was probably the single best show that band ever played), and BLOODY MINDED and DROP DEAD were on the bill also and the whole night was sick...but PUNCH IN THE FACE were unbelievably good (it was the record release for their only 12\", if memory serves). If you like aggressive hardcore punk and you missed PUNCH IN THE FACE, then: 1) you fukkd up, and 2) I'm here to help. Nine songs in ten minutes, and, title notwithstanding, \"Beer Cold, TV Loud, Homosexuals Flaming\" is seriously one of the bangingest bangers of all time, but \"The Start Of Your Ending\" might be even better. \nPUNCH IN THE FACE\n</blockquote>\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/punch-in-the-face-punch-in-the-face-demo-2001","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"/images/image.svg","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"alt":"Fallback Image Indicating Manifest is Missing a Thumbnail"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Flex, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Flex) _missingMdxReference(\"Flex\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Share) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Share\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsx(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: _jsxs(Flex, {\n          gap: \"7\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Box, {\n            children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n              size: \"8\",\n              mb: \"5\"\n            }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n              size: \"4\",\n              color: \"gray\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsx(Work.Share, {})]\n        })\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true}

If there were no joke-y vocals then this band would be deadly, because when they are tough? LUNACHICKS will fucking crush you, and they swing (\"Curve Of Mother's Axe\") at all times. But it's hard to forgive the \"More Than A Feeling\" cover included here...but I'll keep cranking \"Light As A Feather, Stiff As A Board\" for the rest of the day anyway.

BARBED WIRE are the east coast version - there's a lot of Hatchet and Skynyrd in these tunes, the organ often takes the lead....and the leads themselves are freaking deadly. This boy ain't complaining one bit. Hear the falsetto at the end of \"The Thunderhead\" (and \"Chrome Lust\"), the early AC/DC stomp of \"Hellhounds On The Motorway,\" the shameless Van Zant (no \"D\" - if you know what I mean then you know what I mean) strut of \"Livin' And Bleedin'\" - it's all here.

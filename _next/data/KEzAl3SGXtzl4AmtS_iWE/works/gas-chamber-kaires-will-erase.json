Started to post it more than once, but the words never seemed right so I opted for something easier. GAS CHAMBER is not easy, not simple. GAS CHAMBER is deep, visceral, and intense beyond words. This year's Hemorrhaging Light LP on Iron Lung defies description, it is a revolutionary collection of sound that transcends mere hardcore music. So it should not be surprising that this cassette collection that was released before the LP, a series of interludes, compositions (and one banging single), is a total stunner. The two pieces that make up \"Prone\" set the stage for the remainder of Kairos Will Erase, prolonged ambience exploding into massive bursts of advanced hardcore. Goosebump inducing vocals and bass flanged to oblivion, driving the recording (indeed the whole band) through treacherous twists that would have most outfits stumbling over their own fingers. For me, this tape is all about the noise... \"IX\" and \"X\" take up over 25 minutes, and it's that sparse, anxious intermission that makes this presentation of the Corpse With Levity EP (presented here in the same form as the vinyl release) seem wholly different than the first time I listened to it cold. The list of bands that can make so many different sounds and styles all feel like they belong is very short, and this band is at the top. Trying to describe the music is hard enough...but describing the power is impossible. Without question, GAS CHAMBER are among the most intense live bands I have ever seen, but this tape will hold you over until you become one of the The Fortunate Ones.\nKAIROS WILL ERASE\nPhysical copies from Peterwalkee Records\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//1.bp.blogspot.com/-gdrQEZnamfY/VECsno7IX_I/AAAAAAAAK-Q/6VXDUw1fkXE/s1600/gas%2Bchamber%2Bcover%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//1.bp.blogspot.com/-gdrQEZnamfY/VECsno7IX_I/AAAAAAAAK-Q/6VXDUw1fkXE/s1600/gas%2Bchamber%2Bcover%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://gaschamberhardcore.wordpress.com/category/gas-chamber/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gaschamberhardcore.wordpress.com/category/gas-chamber/</a>\n<a href=\"http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/05/gas-chamber.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2010/05/gas-chamber.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://lifeironlungdeath.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://lifeironlungdeath.blogspot.com/</a>\n<a href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-EbztC2tnKgs/VECw8afUhwI/AAAAAAAAK-c/Q9skFs0GEg8/s1600/gas%2Bchamber%2Binside%2Bcopy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//2.bp.blogspot.com/-EbztC2tnKgs/VECw8afUhwI/AAAAAAAAK-c/Q9skFs0GEg8/s1600/gas%2Bchamber%2Binside%2Bcopy.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.peterwalkeerecords.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.peterwalkeerecords.com/</a>\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/buffalo.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/gas-chamber.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Gas Chamber - Kaires Will Erase - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/10/gas-chamber.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">October 17, 2014</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nI've been sitting on this one for far too long.

Today's cassette is the latter. NOT MY SON were from San Antonio and our singer had a correspondence with their singer that we all razzed him about endlessly. Basically this razzing was because we were immature and the singer was a girl (our singer was a boy). We stayed with her in San Antonio in '95, she was super hospitable and way punker than us...I'm pretty sure that was the same show that essentially nobody attended except August from CROWN ROAST (and now PLEASURE CROSS) and he gave me a tape that had INITIAL STATE on it which pretty much blew our minds. Also I think he sang for us that night and we were paid in beer...and not a lot beer. This is snotty vocal punk with a guitarist who sounds like he'd prefer playing metal - I think it holds up well. These tracks were released on wax as well, and I don't know if this cassette ever had a cover.\nAMERICAN DEVIL\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3AFNYurO5s/Uo72rcdjtzI/AAAAAAAAJCw/sGayNKY_Bxk/s1600/not+my+son+copy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">//3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y3AFNYurO5s/Uo72rcdjtzI/AAAAAAAAJCw/sGayNKY_Bxk/s1600/not+my+son+copy.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2013/10/pleasure-cross.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2013/10/pleasure-cross.html</a>\n"]},"thumbnail":[{"format":"image/jpeg","height":113,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2F__ia_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":180},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":121,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2fnot%20my%20son%20copy_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2Fnot%20my%20son%20copy_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192},{"format":"image/jpeg","height":120,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2fnot%20my%20son_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/Not-My-Son_American-Devil-EP%2Fnot%20my%20son_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":192}],"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/not-my-son.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Not My Son - American Devil EP - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on <a href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2013/11/not-my-son.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">November 22, 2013</a>\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n<blockquote>\nSometimes I put tapes on here because of the sounds they contain, and sometimes it's more about the context.

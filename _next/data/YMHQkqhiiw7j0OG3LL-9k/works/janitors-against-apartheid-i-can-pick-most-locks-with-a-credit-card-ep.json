But JANITORS AGAINST APARTHEID were from San Jose and I never saw them live even though I knew the name. They were a killer ska/punk ensemble who rip off CITIZEN FISH (or the other way around) in \"Oh...OK!\" and whose use of horn and weird time signatures floats easily in a sea of contemporary copycats.

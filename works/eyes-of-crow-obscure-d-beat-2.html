Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Textbook raw DBeat - &quot;A Guerra Continua&quot; is one of the most perfect examples of the (sub)genre I&#x27;ve ever heard - a one chord riff into a three chord chorus, driven by blown out cardboard box drums and howling anguish. EYES OF CROW are so brutally simple that you feel like you&#x27;ve heard every song before, and it&#x27;s that simplicity that makes this demo work. I was fukkn hungry for each track because I knew what was waiting for me, and then &quot;Katastrofe&quot; starts and the guitars are buried and it sounds so dark and ominous...like a door is closing. And then it&#x27;s over. In less than ten minutes, my faith in ramshackle DBeat hardcore - a faith that has never wavered - has been strengthened by a seven year old cassette from Spain. Sometimes, punk works in mysterious ways, and sometimes it just hits you in the face.OBSCURE D-BEAT

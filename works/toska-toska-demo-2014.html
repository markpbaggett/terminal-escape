Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I often have a hard time describing or explaining what I &quot;like&quot; or what I&#x27;m &quot;in to,&quot; because it really comes down to what I like at any particular moment, or what I happen to be in to right now. Well, right now I&#x27;m into TOSKA. Maybe there are more blasts that I would ask for, and maybe some of the technical guitar shit is not actually to my liking, but I popped this tape into the trusty Marantz PMD500 (yeah, my vintage Pioneer CT-F900 took a shit, much to my chagrin...and financial detriment) this weekend and it was what I wanted. Powerful. Heavy. Forceful. Bare. Determined. I like to feel like a bulldozer just fired up when I push play, and I like to feel like I need to keep looking over my shoulder as I turn up the volume...I like the sounds to threaten me, and I love when the sounds speak to me. Dark and bleak doesn&#x27;t have to mean &quot;extra reverb,&quot; sometimes you can pull that shit off by just being real.
TOSKA
He&#x27;s always been kept running
Labor built his body to wear this pain as miles have built his mind to forget
But he does not mind dying here in a factory, in a shop
But he does not mind dying on a rail denied his due
Not numbed to his broken body, and not num,bed to his take home pay...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

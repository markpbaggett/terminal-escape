Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The &#x27;90s were a heyday for snotty and snarky garage and/or pop punk that had actual attitude. BORIS THE SPRINKLER and FYP weren&#x27;t bad words, and shared bills with black clad political crust bands...and it wasn&#x27;t weird. Not saying that it was a better time, or that any of those bands are good, just noting the difference - and opening the doors for THE NARDS. Tons of fun and tons of attitude, ass shaking punk rock isn&#x27;t really a bad thing, regardless of subgenre. At their best they remind me of DEAD MILKMEN, at their fastest they conjure up the aforementioned FYP, and there shouldn&#x27;t be anything wrong with enjoying yourself every now and then.
 THE NARDS GREATEST FUCKING HITS
&quot;Hey Kev, you OK?&quot;

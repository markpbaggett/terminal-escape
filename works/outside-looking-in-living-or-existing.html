Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Seriously, I can&#x27;t really think of anything I want form a hardcore band that OUTSIDE LOOKING IN doesn&#x27;t deliver. They got the breakdowns, they got the crucial and desperate lyrics and the delivery to back them up, they are from a place that none of the cool kids give a shit about...and they fukkn rule. Hardcore punk from Chico/Redding. California...so good. You need this band, but I might need them more than you do.
LIVING OR EXISTING
It&#x27;s another disheartening night // On the floor there was nearly a fight // From tough guys throwing their fists // And not giving a shit who they hit // I see people throughout the hall with cliché minds // With uncritical thoughts // In each corner there&#x27;s a social click // I can&#x27;t help feeling that I don&#x27;t fit in // I don&#x27;t feel moved or inspired // I feel like I&#x27;m existing on another dead night // The music rings in my ears but doesn&#x27;t move my heart // The lyrics stand tall but the actions fall short // Too much of what we&#x27;ve fought against lives at the shows // At times I can&#x27;t help but feel the disillusion grow // Tonight is another night that lays stagnant // Leaving me feeling burnt out and alone // Tonight is another disheartening night // Leaving me feeling burnt out and alone // Stagnant. Burnt out. And alone.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They got the breakdowns, they got the crucial and desperate lyrics and the delivery to back them up, they are from a place that none of the cool kids give a shit about...and they fukkn rule. Hardcore punk from Chico/Redding. California...so good.

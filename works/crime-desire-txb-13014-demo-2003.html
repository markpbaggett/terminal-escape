Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Look...time makes legends, okay? I&#x27;ve seen CRIME DESIRE a few times with admittedly mixed results. The first time I saw them I felt like I was watching a parody. Sounds fucked up to say about a band that I like but....shit was real. But punks is freaks, right? And few modern bands are willing to let that flag fly as honestly and proudly as San Diego&#x27;s CRIME DESIRE. The band now (?) is completely different from the band that recorded this demo more than 20 years ago but...time makes legends. Listen to &quot;Face The Facts&quot; and know that these misfits and mutants were on a path. They were driven. They are driven. Also, the convergence of discordant hardcore punk and total dissolution is....well, this recording has aged well. I&#x27;ve seen CRIME DESIRE a few times. I cherish every one of those moments as I listen to these sounds with Future Ears and an old/er heart. CRIME DESIRE are always real, and they have never been anything that they weren&#x27;t. We should all be so lucky. TXB 13014 DEMO 2003

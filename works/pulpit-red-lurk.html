Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Sometime in the 1990s, PULPIT RED started kicking around the dark bars of Oklahoma and denizens emerged from the shadows, thirsty from a taste of that sweet elixir brewed from a mash made of classics. NYC &#x27;77 (Hell, Thunders, etc), a heavy helping of STOOGES, maybe a dash of M.O.T.O. all fermenting in a sea of Middle America humidity....it goes down like a punk rock &#x27;n roll racket. Lurk clocks in well over an hour, with several tracks taking the time they need to fully develop. It&#x27;s a fucking rock record made by some dudes in leather jackets, a record with ballads, bangers and attitude for days. Filler? Oh year, some of that too, but if you&#x27;re going to give me &quot;Zero Night&quot; and &quot;Hard City&quot; then I&#x27;ll take your &quot;Baby&#x27;s In Hiding&quot; all day.  LURKFormer MULTIPLE CHOICE bassist Ben &quot;The Wild Man&quot; Liman (who preceded me in MULTIPLE CHOICE) passed through their ranks, as did ANCIENT CHIESE PENIS drummer Dan Francis (aka Del Langham and/or Phil McCrevis). I would pay $25 to see this band at Kelly&#x27;s on Main with TALL TALES, but that will never happen....

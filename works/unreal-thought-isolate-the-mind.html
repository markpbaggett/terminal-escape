Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think that unless I choose to spend a week or two focused on Canada&#x27;s Atlantic Provinces, I will just be playing catch-up for years to come because the quality and frequency of the output from DIY punks there has remained frighteningly consistent for the last decade. The second tape from UNREAL THOUGHT came out back in 2014, when every punk was stacking flangers on flangers and there were more smoke machines than riffs...when a new wave of DIY rippers all seemingly discovered SISTERS and TONES ON TAIL when they were at summer camp together and made a pact to flood the market. But embedded in that mass of hastily thrown together throwbacks were (are) some brilliant releases and some bands who were using available tools to create their own sounds....no one sounds like UNREAL THOUGHT. Layers of spoken vocals, damaged and piercing guitars, a dark shroud drawn over a punk band who still sounds like a fucking punk band. I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m listening to a band trying to sound like 1984 - I feel like I&#x27;m listening to a band creating a sound that captures their existence. There&#x27;s more where this came from. ISOLATE THE MIND
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was a little late for a band to be able to (so successfully) get away with this kind of feisty pop punk....but THE DUCKBUTTERS pull it off. They were a product of their environment, an environment that included JAWBREAKER and OP IVY, and yet they still made it work*. It would make a lot more sense if this was recorded and released in 1994, so I guess you could say that they were behind their time, but really they were just kids, and that&#x27;s where the honesty comes into play.Honesty is pretty damn important. 
 FELING DIRTY
 (*) - I&#x27;m not knocking JAWBREAKER or OP IVY, I&#x27;m just saying that a lot of people who really liked and tried to emulate those bands started a bunch of really shitty bands. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

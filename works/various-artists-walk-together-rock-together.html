Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 You have to understand....DIY punk in Indonesia didn&#x27;t really start to take hold until years after several generations and movements had evolved and mutated in the so-called First World. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? had a plan to go in 1999 that never materialized, but when CFD was there in 1997 I was on the back of Aca&#x27;s scooter cruising to the US consulate for some bureaucracy and he casually pointed to a government building and told me about the students who were barricaded there in &#x27;97 fighting military cops for days and days. Punk kids.....fighting the fucking army. It was presented so casually and it really put the whole &quot;fighting the system&quot; thing into perspective, you know? Then we had to escape some bandits attacking motorists from an overpass, fixed a flat tire and I forged signatures on a bunch of passports....it was a fucking day. Anyway, this comp dropped in 1997 and that context is pretty important as you listen - you&#x27;re talking about baby punks who had access to the traditional started bands and the first few waves of US, European and Australasian DIY all at once and I can&#x27;t even imagine what that information overload must have felt like. Limited access and unlimited date and...well, what if GORILLA BISCUITS and and GISM and CROSSED OUT were on the same plane? Siempre En Nuestro Corazon is what you get. STRAIGHT ANSWER, GENOCIDE, ANTISEPTIC, DIRTY EDGE, CRYPTICAL DEATH - there are more, and every single track is a slammer. Fidelity optional, passion and intensity mandatory...this is the realest compilation I have listened to in a long long time.WALK TOGETHER ROCK TOGETHER
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

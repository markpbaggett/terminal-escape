Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This 1989 demo was in a pile of stuff I got from a friend years ago and I just kept skipping past it until this past weekend....it was worth the wait. You want this to be some lost goth punk gem, and it gets close at times, but this is pure psychedelic freakout gold - tracks like &quot;Old Nik&quot; and &quot;Drop Dead&quot; just burn and the guitar is impossible to contain. Listen to the vocals on &quot;Professor Heed,&quot; it sounds like she is so busy losing her shit that she can barely make it over to the microphone to lay down her tracks, and then the guitar starts off with some theremin sounding shit lurking under the surface, taking only a short break before filling the last 90 seconds with solos while the drums keep surging forward. I can&#x27;t tell (nor do I care) where these maniacs were coming from and the recording is rough around the edges at times, but this near-hour long demo is going to be one hell of a reward for you monkeys brave enough (read: smart enough) to take the plunge. 
DIRT FILTH AND MAYHEM
Also, more than once when listening to this for the first time, I thought, &quot;This kinda sounds like AMEBIX.&quot; Tell me I&#x27;m crazy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

skipping past it until this past weekend....it was worth the wait. You want this to be some lost goth punk gem, and it gets close at times, but this is pure psychedelic freakout gold - tracks like \"Old Nik\" and \"Drop Dead\" just burn and the guitar is impossible to contain. Listen to the vocals on \"Professor Heed,\" it sounds like she is so busy losing her shit that she can barely make it over to the microphone to lay down her tracks, and then the guitar starts off with some theremin sounding shit lurking under the surface, taking only a short break before filling the last 90 seconds with solos while the drums keep surging forward. I can't tell (nor do I care) where these maniacs were coming from and the recording is rough around the edges at times, but this near-hour long demo is going to be one hell of a reward for you monkeys brave enough (read: smart enough) to take the plunge. \nDIRT FILTH AND MAYHEM\nAlso, more than once when listening to this for the first time, I thought, \"This kinda sounds like AMEBIX.\" Tell me I'm crazy.\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"//2.bp.blogspot.com/-ry_CGpUVfgw/VGrD_gMzHEI/AAAAAAAALLY/Sb6EvOuRAys/s1600/octafish%2Bcover.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e//2.bp.blogspot.com/-ry_CGpUVfgw/VGrD_gMzHEI/AAAAAAAALLY/Sb6EvOuRAys/s1600/octafish%2Bcover.jpg\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"//4.bp.blogspot.com/-7iHmOGSNScQ/VGrKQOQ6jaI/AAAAAAAALLo/HCiX4VJhgSg/s1600/octafish%2Bimg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e//4.bp.blogspot.com/-7iHmOGSNScQ/VGrKQOQ6jaI/AAAAAAAALLo/HCiX4VJhgSg/s1600/octafish%2Bimg.jpg\u003c/a\u003e\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/psychedelic.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/octafish.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Octafish - Dirt Filth And Mayhem demo 1989 - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on \u003ca href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/11/octafish.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eNovember 18, 2014\u003c/a\u003e\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nThis 1989 demo was in a pile of stuff I got from a friend years ago and I just kept skipping past it until this past weekend....it was worth the wait.

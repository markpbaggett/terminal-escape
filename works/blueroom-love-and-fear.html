Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I can easily imagine going all in on BLUEROOM had I found them when Love &amp; Fear was released in 1989 and and they probably ventured up to Norman, Oklahoma (where I moved in 1990) with some frequency because that&#x27;s where the cool college/alt bands played. And BLUEROOM play cool college/alt music. You picture them with candles and shit, maybe some tapestries, flowing shirts and effects pedals...that&#x27;s their sound. That sound wasn&#x27;t heavy or punk enough to be grunge and they lean on blues rock as much as (or more than) the brooding goth persona they portray so they were perhaps outdated before they started, but they were also from Pauls Valley in south central Oklahoma where time and/or trends may have been somewhat skewed - though that town with a scant 6,000 residents that also gave us CARNAGE and SUBSANITY, so there&#x27;s that. There&#x27;s a place for BLUEROOM (or there was a place for BLUEROOM in 1989) in a far away world of guitar based dark alternative rock, and Wayne Hussey aficionados will surely find some comfort in Love &amp; Fear...which is so say that this writer found some comfort in Love &amp; Fear...LOVE &amp; FEAR
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And BLUEROOM play cool college/alt music. You picture them with candles and shit, maybe some tapestries, flowing shirts and effects pedals...that's their sound. That sound wasn't heavy or punk enough to be grunge and they lean on blues rock as much as (or more than) the brooding goth persona they portray so they were perhaps outdated before they started, but they were also from Pauls Valley in south central Oklahoma where time and/or trends may have been somewhat skewed - though that town with a scant 6,000 residents that also gave us CARNAGE and SUBSANITY, so there's that. There's a place for BLUEROOM (or there was a place for BLUEROOM in 1989) in a far away world of guitar based dark alternative rock, and Wayne Hussey aficionados will surely find some comfort in Love \u0026 Fear...which is so say that this writer found some comfort in Love \u0026 Fear...LOVE \u0026 FEAR\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2021/09/carnage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2021/09/carnage.html\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/07/subsanity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2014/07/subsanity.html\u003c/a\u003e\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/blueroom-love-and-fear","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"/images/image.svg","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"alt":"Fallback Image Indicating Manifest is Missing a Thumbnail"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Flex, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Flex) _missingMdxReference(\"Flex\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Share) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Share\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsx(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: _jsxs(Flex, {\n          gap: \"7\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Box, {\n            children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n              size: \"8\",\n              mb: \"5\"\n            }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n              size: \"4\",\n              color: \"gray\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsx(Work.Share, {})]\n        })\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ?

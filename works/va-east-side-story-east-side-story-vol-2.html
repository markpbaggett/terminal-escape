Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A repeat visit from SUNNY &amp; THE SUNLINERS to start things off, then LITTLE ROYAL, DON &amp; JUAN and LLOYD PRICE stack up three of the most crucial unrequited love songs back to back to back. And the nine songs that follow continue in the tradition established by Volume 1....slow, timeless, laid back, and impossibly cool. DONNIE ELBERT&#x27;s &quot;Have I Sinned&quot; is like WAYNE NEWTON&#x27;s &quot;Heart&quot; with a burlesque flare, and the sweeping strings in &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; from BRENDA &amp; THE TABULATIONS will make it very difficult to....well, dry your eyes. 
EAST SIDE STORY vol.2

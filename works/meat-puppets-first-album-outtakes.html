Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 There are probably some people reading this who don&#x27;t realize that they need to listen to early MEAT PUPPETS recordings from two sessions in November of 1981. You might be one of those people and, if I&#x27;m being honest, I was one of those people until I popped this morsel in my ear holes. So if you are one of those people who simply don&#x27;t know (yet) until now.....? You&#x27;re welcome. Because now you know. Desert weird is an entirely different kind of weird, and these recordings are so gloriously fukkn raw that it makes me feel like I never need to listen to the first two LPs again (even though I&#x27;m going to listen to them on my ride downtown as soon as I eat this sandwich). Again...you&#x27;re welcome.FIRST ALBUM OUTTAKES

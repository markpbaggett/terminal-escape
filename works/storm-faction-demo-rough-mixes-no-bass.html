Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I&#x27;ve got a tape of roughs from the unreleased Here In Our Hearts session from INTERNAL AUTONOMY, and there are more rough mixes from a band listed as STORM FACTION tacked onto the end. Never heard of &#x27;em, and can&#x27;t find any information about them, but they surely sound like a bare knuckled pisstake of an ignorant UK Oi! band, and I kinda love it. Railing against PC punks with a half drunk exaggerated accent, all while the band decks out full throated ragers like &quot;Runnin&#x27; Outta Time&quot; and &quot;Weak Link&quot; (I ain&#x27;t into politics!). A freaked out &quot;Anarchoi Dub Stylee&quot; (later followed up by the slightly longer &quot;More Anarchoi! Dub Stylee,&quot; naturally) and even rougher reference mixes of two cuts that appear to be veering in a more UKHC (say Scrap Metal, perhaps) direction - just drum machine and vocals on these but that&#x27;s no reason to not share a screamer like &quot;Come Uppance Of The Macho Male,&quot; right? My thoughts exactly.  So at the end of a year full of frustration and loss and questions and distrust, I&#x27;ll tack on a little mystery. STORM FACTION

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Got this filthy shell from Brett a while back, and I guess it&#x27;s the polar opposite of the sounds on yesterday&#x27;s LUOMO mix. WROTH are the sonic equivalent of getting shoved around by three shitty dudes while you&#x27;re trying to walk down the hall to go to the bathroom. You&#x27;re not sure if you&#x27;re going to piss your pants or get your ass kicked - or both - as they slap you around like a cat who just cornered a mouse in the basement, occasionally sinking a claw in your fragile skin here and there as you try to make an escape. These three fellows from Prince Edward Island spent two years creating just under ten minutes of disgusting sound - a bass/drum/vocal trio that never once settles for anything approaching cleanliness or cohesion, they just vomit churn riffs, squirm all over the drums and then yell at the mess. If there is an actual or appropriate soundtrack for the current state of things, it&#x27;s not calculated precision...it&#x27;s primal regression. An invitation to return to the caves.

These three fellows from Prince Edward Island spent two years creating just under ten minutes of disgusting sound - a bass/drum/vocal trio that never once settles for anything approaching cleanliness or cohesion, they just vomit churn riffs, squirm all over the drums and then yell at the mess. If there is an actual or appropriate soundtrack for the current state of things, it's not calculated precision...it's primal regression.

WROTH are the sonic equivalent of getting shoved around by three shitty dudes while you're trying to walk down the hall to go to the bathroom. You're not sure if you're going to piss your pants or get your ass kicked - or both - as they slap you around like a cat who just cornered a mouse in the basement, occasionally sinking a claw in your fragile skin here and there as you try to make an escape.

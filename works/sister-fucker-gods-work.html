Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The first time I saw SISTER FUCKER it took me a few days to fully recover. Two people creating such a phenomenal racket that could be palatable if they wanted to make it so. But these two people seemed dead set on destroying the songs they had created, and it was fucking glorious. God&#x27;s Work indeed, reinventing and mutating and mangling erstwhile catchy, angular punk songs. Remember what KARP did to kinda heavy punk stuff? Remember what MELT BANANA did to chaotic hardcore? This is what SISTER FUCKER did to whatever their music was in its previous life. And in that destruction, of course: new life. I haven&#x27;t seen a band like SISTER FUCKER since SISTER FUCKER...because this was it. SISTER FUCKER
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

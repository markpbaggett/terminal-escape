Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A most excellent comp from 1996, released on cassette by Experimental from Portugal and on CD by Boisléve, We May Fight A Battle... concentrates on heavy edge/vegan hardcore, but since it was the &#x27;90s there is more than enough crossover into other subgenres. The easy highlight is Lithuania&#x27;s SC - disjointed punk that seems like perhaps it wants to be metal but doesn&#x27;t quite pull it off, these songs are well worth the entire cassette and I find myself scouring the internet searching their few cassette only releases (it is so far a fruitless search, but it is not finished). STONEWALL, Portugal&#x27;s X-ACTO and Brazil&#x27;s PERSONAL CHOICE fall nicely into the straight edge hardcore box though all write songs more interesting than a generic genre descriptor might suggest. BY ALL MEANS from Modena, Italy were the first band I ever drove on tour back in 1997, and the sonic assault they delivered at those shows has not been lessened by a decade and a half - I still think they are a seriously under appreciated band, pure and personal brutality. MEANSTREAM are gruff heavy hardcore with an affinity for mosh and Mexico&#x27;s AUTOCONTROL round out the line up. AUTOCONTROL seem to have a criminally limited discography (this cassette and one track on a 1999 compilation LP) but their multi vocal doom tinged metallic crust are also worth the entire cassette, so now you have even more reason to get amongst this...
WE MAY FIGHT A BATTLE...THAT CAN&#x27;T BE WON

The easy highlight is Lithuania's SC - disjointed punk that seems like perhaps it wants to be metal but doesn't quite pull it off, these songs are well worth the entire cassette and I find myself scouring the internet searching their few cassette only releases (it is so far a fruitless search, but it is not finished). STONEWALL, Portugal's X-ACTO and Brazil's PERSONAL CHOICE fall nicely into the straight edge hardcore box though all write songs more interesting than a generic genre descriptor might suggest. BY ALL MEANS from Modena, Italy were the first band I ever drove on tour back in 1997, and the sonic assault they delivered at those shows has not been lessened by a decade and a half - I still think they are a seriously under appreciated band, pure and personal brutality. MEANSTREAM are gruff heavy hardcore with an affinity for mosh and Mexico's AUTOCONTROL round out the line up. AUTOCONTROL seem to have a criminally limited discography (this cassette and one track on a 1999 compilation LP) but their multi vocal doom tinged metallic crust are also worth the entire cassette, so now you have even more reason to get amongst this...\nWE MAY FIGHT A BATTLE...THAT CAN'T BE WON\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"//3.bp.blogspot.com/-3BFMN1rjvbw/UVUuJAVhRhI/AAAAAAAAHis/_DSsZK_FybA/s1600/we+may+fight+a+battle+copy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e//3.bp.blogspot.com/-3BFMN1rjvbw/UVUuJAVhRhI/AAAAAAAAHis/_DSsZK_FybA/s1600/we+may+fight+a+battle+copy.jpg\u003c/a\u003e\n"]},"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/mix-tape.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/va-we-may-fight-a-battle-that-cant-be-won.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"v/a - We May Fight A Battle That Can't Be Won - v/a - We May Fight A Battle That Can't Be Won: International Hardcore Compilation - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on \u003ca href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2013/03/we-may-fight-battle-that-cant-be-won.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eMarch 29, 2013\u003c/a\u003e\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nA most excellent comp from 1996, released on cassette by Experimental from Portugal and on CD by Boisléve, We May Fight A Battle... concentrates on heavy edge/vegan hardcore, but since it was the '90s there is more than enough crossover into other subgenres.

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 If you tried to describe PLEASURE BLADE to me I would probably pass. I would probably not be interested. You might say it&#x27;s kinda dreary and atonal, but that it was also loose and almost amateurish sounding. You might talk about the slow screwed jangly guitars in &quot;State Fair&quot; distracting from the vocals that are just....dark and off - not like drunk and damaged, just...off. You might even mention say that PLEASURE BLADE land like a(nother) &#x27;90s indie/grunge/alt throwback and you wouldn&#x27;t be (entirely) wring and I would probably pass. And that would be my loss, because everything here...works. So I&#x27;m not going to describe PLEASURE BLADE. I&#x27;m not going to talk about how they sound or what their songs reming me of. I&#x27;m just going to say that I recommend listening to Gangstalkers while you&#x27;re alone. And And I&#x27;m going to say that, like so many of the good things, PLEASURE BLADE makes more sense when you&#x27;re finished that they will when you start.GANGSTALKERS
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

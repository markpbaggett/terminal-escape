Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hard driving St. Louis punk with the kind of loose, casual hooks that reminds me of OBSERVERS and &#x27;90s East Bay. But perhaps it&#x27;s the vocals that really make SELF HELP stand out, powerful, up front belts that harness Anna Joy Springer&#x27;s legacy and rockets it into the new millennium (and yes, I know that Anna Joy is still never active in this millennium, but I&#x27;m trying to make a pointless analogy here). Killer two minute creamers, one after another...addictive as hell. 
SELF HELP
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

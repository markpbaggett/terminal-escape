Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A gloriously schmaltzy set of &#x27;70s instrumentals with guitar leads. Closer to melancholy Montenegro soundtracks than the cheese of Guitar Moods-style series that fill thrift store bins....but it&#x27;s close. Hawaiian Herb Ohta shares space with Belgian Francis Goya and Japanese/French ripper Claude Ciari (whose cover of &quot;Summer Night&quot; is the soundtrack to the worst burlesque routine you&#x27;ve never wanted to see). For some reason, this bootleg from Singapore has seven fewer tracks than the Indonesian bootleg by the same name, but includes a random edit of a Lonnie Smith track that didn&#x27;t make the original. None of this information is important, of course, but Sonny James&#x27; &quot;Maria Elena&quot; kinda sounds like a 1980s Willie Nelson cut or a weird instrumental rendition of Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s Got You.&quot; GUITAR IN GOLD
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

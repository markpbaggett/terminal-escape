Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One man (or...one genius?) bedroom drum machine metal from São Paulo. Sole member Rudolf, The Proud offers up seven doses of full throttle black/power metal as CATACOMB VOICES with incessant leads and a song construction/delivery that almost makes it seem like this year&#x27;s debut release was created as one long piece - many songs have no end, just a quick fade, and some start the way with no real beginning. High end and anxious, the solos border on comical even though there&#x27;s nothing whatsoever to suggest that there is a tongue in this cheek. 
There&#x27;s a fine line between innocence and brilliance, and I think in this case the purity of vision helps to blur that line. Repetitive drum machine stomps and relentless hammer-on sweatpants riffing isn&#x27;t exactly most people&#x27;s idea of a good time, but it feels real here....it feels honest. Most of the evil conjured by Rudulf&#x27;s prior entity SOVEREIGN has been supplanted by driving metal power, though the vocals still serve up a demonic edge and CATACOMB VOICES seem to be in a constant struggle for clarity, which is part of what makes it sound so real. Basically...I&#x27;m in. 
CATACOMB VOICES

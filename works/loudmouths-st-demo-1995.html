Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The first show I saw in San Francisco was in 1994, before I had fully moved here from LA. It was in the Western Addition, some bar I never went to or heard of again. BRAIN TRANSPLANTS played - they were brilliant and they were freaks - and Dulcinea and Beth from THE LOUDMOUTHS were at the bar. I know it might seem weird to remember something that random; I had never heard of the band and certainly didn&#x27;t know the members, but these women and their crew owned that fukkn show. To my small town, small time ass they were fierce and wild and punk as shit - not like the spikes and studs punk, but the don&#x27;t give a FUCK punks, the kind that is way more punk than the spikes and studs kind. I saw them I don&#x27;t even know how many times after I moved here, and I always thought that if &quot;garage rock&quot; actually meant this, then I would be a garage rocker for life, because the shows were sweaty and off the damn rails every time. And as good as the shows were, I was pleased to (re)learn that this 25+ year old demo tape swings hard and rocks even harder. THE LOUDMOUTHSI ran into Beth at a packed noise show in the Mojave a couple of years ago. I was sitting at the bar between bands and she was buying drinks for her crew. I dunno, I think it&#x27;s kinda weird but also kinda awesome to say to someone who you know only very peripherally &quot;I remember the first time I saw you. It was a super long time ago and I thought you were a total fucking bad ass.&quot; We shot the shit for a bit about SF and about the desert and that was that. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Listen to some words that may or not be &quot;feeling is a pain&quot; repeated. PUBERTY WOUNDS have been here before, and their damage has manifested in other realms. But today I want you to listen to feeling. Today I want you to feel pain, because pain is the essence of feeling. Know that your puberty is never ending, know that your evolution will fail. PUBERTY WOUNDS are the sound of eternal adolescence. Eternal frustration. Eternal failure....the sound of feeling. The sound of pain. Sweet dreams, my friend.WERE IT NOT THAT I HAVE BAD DREAMS
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Was walking down Valencia with Karoline last week and saw the choicest &#x27;70s Malibu - lowered, LEDs in the fukkn rims, velvet everywhere, paint on point....and these were the tunes coming from the open windows. Just parked in front of a fire hydrant. Empty. Idling. It was as if the car itself was on a solo cruise, and it was awesome.  It made me think of these volumes, and I ripped vol.10 the next day. I think THE ESCORTS&#x27; track is my favorite - even though TOMMY JAMES &amp; THE SHONDELLES classic &quot;Crystal Persuasion&quot; is probably the best song included, I hadn&#x27;t heard &quot;Look Of Your Shoulder&quot; before this is it&#x27;s pure fukkn bliss. The whole damn comp is bliss, until these masters of under the radar slammers drop The Godfather into the game near the end and things quickly escalate to ecstasy. &quot;You Were Mine&quot; from FIREFLIES and a blown out solid from THE M7Ms &amp; THE PEANUTS close out the game and I really just want to live that different past present tense life for just one night.

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I posted this one in the early days of The Escape (almost eleven years ago - am I really still doing this shit?!), but this cassette from 1987 bears revisiting. A collection of recordings from Dunville, Ontario&#x27;s PROBLEM CHILDREN that includes their first demo from 1982, the What&#x27;s Is All About demo from SUBTERFUGE (who had a short run during a PROBLEM CHILDREN hiatus in &#x27;83) early versions of most of the tracks on the criminally underrated The Future Of The World Belongs To Us LP. It&#x27;s not everything, by any means, but it&#x27;s a great collection of under the radar bangers from an under the radar band - off the rails irreverent hardcore punk. Who doesn&#x27;t want that? Dummies.
DON&#x27;T GIVE UP!!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 A perfect mix tape is truly a thing of beauty. I am pretty good at them, but perfect....? I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d go that far. Dave makes perfect mix tapes, and Jensen is a master. August though....August outdid himself with Paul O&#x27;Neill. No genre is off limits, so you get JAMES BROWN into STRANGULATED BEATOFFS. You get UNSANE into SMALL FACES. You get DENIECE WILLIAMS into BIG&#x27;N. You get COP SHOOT COP into JAMES BROWN (again....and it&#x27;s the same song, which is genius).  YOu get ED HALL because August lived in Texas. The segues are perfect, every song is a banger, I&#x27;m just here hoping that he put PISSED JEANS after PAIN TEENS because the band names rhymed and more people need to know WELLINGTON because...well, just trust me. August is a one of a kind, a truly brilliant and beautiful being. And he makes a mean fukkn mix tape. So think about that while you&#x27;re listening to STEPPENWOLF&#x27;s &quot;Hippo Stomp&quot; and wondering what you&#x27;ve done with your life on this final day of the traditional work week. PAUL O&#x27;NEILL

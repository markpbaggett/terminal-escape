Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nerds are gonna know &quot;Sit On My Face Stevie Nicks&quot; (the nerds-in-training should get to know it) and there&#x27;s a solid retrospective LP that came out in the &#x27;00s that captures a lot of the brilliant madness of THE ROTTERS. But tape traders....man, those fools had our backs before we were even paying attention. This discretely (read: poorly) labeled cassette has two brilliant bare bones ROTTERS sessions, one labeled Moor Punk College Session (1979) and one label Mystic Session (1984) and I swear if the fools who collected material for the aforementioned LP had had access to this tape then it would have been a double album. &quot;Thank God I&#x27;m Damned&quot; sounds demonic, &quot;Autolobotomy&quot; hits like a lost KBD burner, &quot;Delousing Shower&quot; is like DWARVES with roughshod GERMS energy. These songs are absolutely in your face and the recordings are about as perfect as you can ask for. So if you&#x27;re tryna get a little dirty this Wednesday morning...then look no further. THE ROTTERS - MYSTIC &amp; MOOR(E)THE ROTTERS - MYSTIC &amp; MOOR(E)

that captures a lot of the brilliant madness of THE ROTTERS. But tape traders....man, those fools had our backs before we were even paying attention. This discretely (read: poorly) labeled cassette has two brilliant bare bones ROTTERS sessions, one labeled Moor Punk College Session (1979) and one label Mystic Session (1984) and I swear if the fools who collected material for the aforementioned LP had had access to this tape then it would have been a double album. \"Thank God I'm Damned\" sounds demonic, \"Autolobotomy\" hits like a lost KBD burner, \"Delousing Shower\" is like DWARVES with roughshod GERMS energy. These songs are absolutely in your face and the recordings are about as perfect as you can ask for. So if you're tryna get a little dirty this Wednesday morning...then look no further. THE ROTTERS - MYSTIC \u0026 MOOR(E)THE ROTTERS - MYSTIC \u0026 MOOR(E)\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n"]},"thumbnail":[{"format":"image/jpeg","height":45,"id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/ROTTERS%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","service":[{"@id":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/ROTTERS%2F__ia_thumb.jpg","@type":"ImageService2","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}],"type":"Image","width":180}],"type":"Manifest"},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/subject/punk.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/artist/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/api/facet/source/cassette.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"ROTTERS - Terminal Escape","description":"Originally ripped by Terminal Escape, posted on \u003ca href=\"https://terminalescape.blogspot.com/2024/07/rotters.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eJuly 24, 2024\u003c/a\u003e\n\nDescription from Terminal Escape:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\nThe nerds are gonna know \"Sit On My Face Stevie Nicks\" (the nerds-in-training should get to know it) and there's a solid retrospective LP that came out in the '00s that captures a lot of the brilliant madness of THE ROTTERS.

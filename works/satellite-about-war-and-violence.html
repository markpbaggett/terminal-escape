Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 When CFD went to Indonesia in 2008, SATELLITE were OGs. We didn&#x27;t play with them (would have loved to, of courser), but the shirts were everywhere and bootleg CDrs seemed to be in every distro. I snagged a couple and jammed them when we got home and.....there was just an urgency hiding in the simplicity of their songs that I couldn&#x27;t seem to wrap my head around. While I still can&#x27;t put a finger on why they are so good, this copy of 2000&#x27;s About War And Violence serves as an excellent reminder (to me) that STELLITE do the fukkn thing right, and sometimes that&#x27;s worth way more than a bunch of words trying to describe why and how. Sometimes.....it just is. A little out of tune sometimes, a little loose most of the time, a little rudimentary in general and absolute fucking fire from start to finish. Because the shit is real, and when it&#x27;s truly real you can hear it. When it&#x27;s truly real you can feel it. ABOUT WAR AND VIOLENCE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don&#x27;t remember when I met Jason Griffin, but I feel like I&#x27;ve know of the dude for a solid 20+ years. HICKEY crossed paths with his band TRES KIDS during one (of many) jaunts through the Southern States, and there&#x27;s a pretty famous photo of someone from the band passed out next to a pile of vomit, curled up around a HICKEY CD...and over time these are the associations that stick with you. I missed DIVORCE, I missed NO, I feel like I maybe played with GOAT SHANTY in Richmond in 2002, definitely saw AMERICAN CHEESEBURGER in Texas in the mid-&#x27;00s, then NO STATIK played with HARSH WORDS in Atlanta in 2013. The point is, it&#x27;s not like we are tight or anything, but man, I really like that dude...and he hits the drums really good. Like, really good. I also missed SHAVED CHRIST, who claim one of the coolest monikers in modern hardcore and are complete rippers. Like TOTAL FURY crashing headlong into NEON CHRIST, these Georgia kids just fukkn burn through forced, disjointed and ultimately destructive US hardcore punk. No fancy studio work, just one screaming (loose) guitar track amped up higher than the rest of the mix and a crew of fellas banging the shit out of some punk because that&#x27;s what they fukkn do. There was one six song EP that came shortly after this 2011 demo - I suggest seeking out that slab. You need it. 
SHAVED CHRIST
Listen to the one guitar overdub in &quot;No Crux&quot; and then come talk to me about punk. Fukk.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I first heard Glenn Branca&#x27;s name in the 1980s, associated with SONIC YOUTH members and early NYC no wave experimentation (I had no idea what &quot;no wave&quot; was at the time). Later I read Zorn mentioning him in the same context, but I never heard the sounds until I got a promo copy of Symphony No. 6: Devil Choirs At The Gates Of Heaven to play on my radio show in Ponca City, Oklahoma....and just think about that for a moment. More than three decades later (and four decades after it was recorded), these sounds still put me in an absolute fucking trance. SYMPHONY NO. 2: THE PEAK OF THE SACRED

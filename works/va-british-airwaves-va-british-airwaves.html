Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think that my vinyl copy of this release was the product of an expedition to Tulsa in the late &#x27;80s (teenage Wizard was neither adventurous nor mobile) and resulted in my discovery of 18 then-new-to-me bands (which is precisely what a comp is supposed to do). That said, the 1000 MEXICANS track gets stuck in my head at least once a month (it&#x27;s that damn bass line), THE RENEES are killer, THE THREE JOHNS track is mediocre but resulted in several of their records in my arsenal, and this JAZAWHAKI tune is as infectious as anything I can imagine.In addition, you get burners from THE GLOBAL INFANTALISTS, HAGAR THE WOMB (my first introduction was this track), THE MOODISTS, NIKKI SUDDEN, and THE RENEES (&quot;Drink Problem&quot; seemed so racy as a 16 year old...) among many others. I think the motivation for this comp was financial, as British Airwaves seems to have been compiled and released by a label hoping to break UK post punk/new wave acts into the US market, but I can&#x27;t really see anything here that we Americans ever gave a shit about aside from NEW MODEL ARMY....though this is still my favorite NEW MODEL ARMY jam. But seriously, &quot;Last Pop Song&quot; is beyond devastating....turn and face the lights.
BRITISH AIRWAVES
Turn up the music, one last time // This is the last pop song, come on and sing // This is the last pop song, it didn&#x27;t mean a thing...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Somebody please, give me just a minute to explain my misery...
Y&#x27;all want to go for another ride, right? As if THE VANGUARDS opening track weren&#x27;t enough, East Side Story vol.4 delivers a dozen ounces of solid fukkn gold, anchored by two gems from BARBARA MASON, perfect curation demonstrated by casually slipping THE RADIANTS &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Big Thing&quot; in between Mason&#x27;s call and answer/coming of age &quot;Yes I&#x27;m Ready&quot; and &quot;Oh How It Hurts.&quot; This one is all about love and pain (I mean, aren&#x27;t they all?), ending up with THE CRUISERS&#x27; &quot;I Need You So&quot; and (oh yeah) they drop in PERCY SLEDGE as if to remind you that the &#x27;60s legacy is so much more than AM radio toppers. Instead of a summer strip packed with rounded steel, this fourth volume feels like a quiet, lonely winter road on a crystal clear night...pulling your someone closer when BILLY STEWART hits that falsetto yowl before the chorus of &quot;I Do Love You.&quot; Simpler times musings surely abound, but we can find these corners of simplicity in any reality....sometimes you just have to reach a little deeper. 
EAST SIDE STORY vol.4
I give you everything I got trying to hold on to your precious love
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

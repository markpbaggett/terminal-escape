Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Time and place hold equal importance in discussion of context. I never saw JANITORS AGAINST APARTHEID, but I could have seen them at that show in Temecula in &#x27;94. We also could have crossed paths in Cornwall in &#x27;96 or Indianapolis in 1993 (man, that &quot;teen center&quot; was super weird and the guy was a dick and we stole weird shit from him to try to sell because he wouldn&#x27;t pay us and my wife still makes fun of me for that to this day - even though she didn&#x27;t know me in those days....it&#x27;s a good story, I&#x27;ll tell you some time). But JANITORS AGAINST APARTHEID were from San Jose and I never saw them live even though I knew the name. They were a killer ska/punk ensemble who rip off CITIZEN FISH (or the other way around) in &quot;Oh...OK!&quot; and whose use of horn and weird time signatures floats easily in a sea of contemporary copycats. How many Escape visitors will listen.....? My guess is less than 30, but the ones who do will not be disappointed. This is arguably as dated as anything I have shared here....but I&#x27;ll be damned if it isn&#x27;t also excellent. 
I CAN PICK MOST LOCKS WITH A CREDIT CARD

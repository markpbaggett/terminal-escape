Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Almost finished running through this essential oldies collection, and the folks at East Side Records really honed in their attack for the last two volumes. LITTLE ANTHONY makes a return visit, as do  East Side veterans THE CHANTELS and the &quot;Duke Of Earl&quot; guy GENE CHANDLER with a slow slammer entitled &quot;Rainbow.&quot; Overall, this one is a little fuller and funkier (check the drums around the 1:30 mark of opening cut &quot;The Bells&quot; from THE ORIGINALS), but there&#x27;s still plenty of the sweet swoon that keeps people coming back to these under-the-radar cruising comps - take BARBARA LEWIS, THE DELLS&#x27; &quot;Oh What A Night&quot; and JERRY BUTLER&#x27;s would-be classic &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; as examples, and then sink your ears into THE METALLICS and THE JIVE HIVE just because you can. This one&#x27;s about love, about warm nights, about being young and optimistic even in the face of a painful reality.  They&#x27;re talking about love, but the fear, the hope, the despair...it all transfers to the real world.

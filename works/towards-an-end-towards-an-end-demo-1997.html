Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Steel yourself before this one, kids. 1990s suburbia was a motherfucker for punk and hardcore - subgenres and subcultures that had once been a thing of mystery were plastered all over popular culture. The sounds of rebellion that had fueled a generation&#x27;s rage had become the very establishment, and now the floodgates were open. Enter TOWARDS AN END. From the Tri-Valley (40ish miles inland from San Francisco), they came from ashes of RELY, a pretty damn good teenage SXEHC band, and delivered some of the harmless emotional hardcore that was seemingly everywhere for a solid decade. These kids did one better by throwing in a bunch of pro-establishment, anti-abortion, anti-sex lyrics because....fukk man, I don&#x27;t know, church or something? Full admission though: It makes it pretty fun to listen to. There&#x27;s something entertaining about how earnest (and ridiculous) some of these cuts are, and it&#x27;s ramped up a notch because you know they are serious. I mean, I still back DALTONIC&#x27;s Radio On*, and I guess I put this in the same department. Plus, when Broken Heart &amp; Shooting Stars opens with the line &quot;Daddy I miss you, I&#x27;m sorry I pushed you away...&quot; I am inexplicably reminded of THE GIRLS&#x27; &quot;Jeffrey I Hear You,&quot; and that&#x27;s one of the greatest songs ever so maybe it just puts me in the right mindset. Demos from 1997 and 1998 included in the link (because as much as I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to check it out once, I&#x27;m fucking certain you aren&#x27;t going to check it out twice), and I have no clue what these fellows did after TOWARDS AN END, if anything. &quot;Family life&quot; is a probably pretty decent guess. BROKEN HEARTS &amp; SHOOTING STARSTOWARDS AN END* - Anyone who has closely watched Bob Kasitz (LACK OF INTEREST, etc) play drums, will know that he props up his battered hi hat stand with a stack of trashed CDs. Many years ago I was watching him set up for the stage potato position and noticed a copy of &quot;Radio On&quot; with a completely thrashed and cracked jewel case at the top of the stack. I mean, here I was in two thousand and whatever, watching a reformed INFEST, and this legendary dude is packing around a CD from a band I played with (twice) in Iowa in 1994.  It wasn&#x27;t really that big of a deal, and I&#x27;m sure there were (are) hundreds of copies of that disc languishing in distros so it shouldn&#x27;t really be weird to see one repurposed and given new life as a hi hat shim, but it was still a mental moment that made me smile.

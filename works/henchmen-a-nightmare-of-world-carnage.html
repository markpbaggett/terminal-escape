Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Suspend belief before you read any further, and suspend hope before you press play....HENCHMEN are about to fuck up your world. If drunk, death obsessed horror rap is your cup of tea then you&#x27;ve found your grail, young savage...while those among you who still (somehow) thought the world was a decent place are about to get a dose of reality from A Nightmare Of World Carnage. TC Bonelocs&#x27; beats are enough to make you shivver on their own, and accompanied by a bevy of depression dealers (X-Raided, J-Dog, Lil Sicx) they sound straight deadly. DJ EONS ONE, Lepr and LE-DOG add beats on a couple of tracks and if you&#x27;re paying attention you know that the fools laying the foundation are West Bay royalty. This is the sound of the words behind the headlines you skip past because you don&#x27;t want to feel uncomfortable...A NIGHTMARE OF WORLD CARNAGE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

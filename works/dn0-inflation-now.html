Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The world of improvisational non-music that these people inhabit keeps drawing me closer. I don&#x27;t understand it (and I don&#x27;t pretend to), but this racket that DN0 created in 2020 is like a vacuum that keeps sucking me into its hose. It&#x27;s like a deconstruction of the No New York comp, the idiosyncratic parts isolated and abandoned....combined with other parts from other creations from all enduring a similar fate. Hear the instruments falling apart during, and as a part of, the tracks themselves. Hear vocals manifested as blurts of frustration while feedback wails absently. These fellows are either geniuses......or extremely fucking lucky. Listen to &quot;Classified.&quot; INFLATION NOW!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

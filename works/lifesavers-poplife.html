Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Back in July when I left for some dates on the road, I put out a plea for strangers (and/or) friends to bring me tapes. I did this for obvious reasons (I mean...tapes, right?), but also because you never know what kind of conversation/s might result from a request like that. Unless you count the HOT LOAD tape packing in an envelope with a joint that was delivered by a UPS driver in Pomona, folks only came through twice. Some bangers from a nice couple in Morro Bay (y&#x27;all came by in Los Osos a few years ago too, you should send me your address and I&#x27;ll send you something nice) and a bloke in Eugene who lingered around the table on and off for a chunk of the show while we talked about lots of shit - including the batch of tapes he brought by. Fellow has an interesting focus: Christian punk and alt. Curiously, we didn&#x27;t delve into the ethics or the why or the conflicts or really any of the background at all, I just asked questions about the bands and their connections, much like I would when talking to any expert in a field about which I know....nothing. The other tapes he handed off will likely pop up eventually, but LIFESAVERS comes first - classic &#x27;90s indie/alt sound that reminds me of TEENAGE FANCLUB, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, THE SMITHEREENS and the like - even touches of later JAMC from time to time. Everything sounds slower and more laid back (read: more accessible) than it should (&quot;Surf With God&quot; in particular) - almost like the cool neighbor is trying to make sounds that the elders will approve of, but will still lure the bad kids to youth group on Wednesday night. Take the lone burner &quot;Skate&quot; for example: My skateboard is no crime / There&#x27;s hungry children cryin&#x27; / There&#x27;s politicians lyin&#x27; // The crime I see Mr. Police is this world don&#x27;t know where to go when it dies. See what they did there? No doubt, Poplife sounds familiar and comfortable even when it lands pretty flat sonically, but...it was an interesting conversation and one that I hope to continue at some point. POPLIFE
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some bangers from a nice couple in Morro Bay (y'all came by in Los Osos a few years ago too, you should send me your address and I'll send you something nice) and a bloke in Eugene who lingered around the table on and off for a chunk of the show while we talked about lots of shit - including the batch of tapes he brought by. Fellow has an interesting focus: Christian punk and alt. Curiously, we didn't delve into the ethics or the why or the conflicts or really any of the background at all, I just asked questions about the bands and their connections, much like I would when talking to any expert in a field about which I know....nothing. The other tapes he handed off will likely pop up eventually, but LIFESAVERS comes first - classic '90s indie/alt sound that reminds me of TEENAGE FANCLUB, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, THE SMITHEREENS and the like - even touches of later JAMC from time to time. Everything sounds slower and more laid back (read: more accessible) than it should (\"Surf With God\" in particular) - almost like the cool neighbor is trying to make sounds that the elders will approve of, but will still lure the bad kids to youth group on Wednesday night. Take the lone burner \"Skate\" for example: My skateboard is no crime / There's hungry children cryin' / There's politicians lyin' // The crime I see Mr. Police is this world don't know where to go when it dies. See what they did there? No doubt, Poplife sounds familiar and comfortable even when it lands pretty flat sonically, but...it was an interesting conversation and one that I hope to continue at some point. POPLIFE\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/lifesavers-poplife","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"/images/image.svg","type":"image/jpeg","width":600,"height":400,"alt":"Fallback Image Indicating Manifest is Missing a Thumbnail"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Flex, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Flex) _missingMdxReference(\"Flex\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Share) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Share\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsx(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: _jsxs(Flex, {\n          gap: \"7\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Box, {\n            children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n              size: \"8\",\n              mb: \"5\"\n            }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n              size: \"4\",\n              color: \"gray\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsx(Work.Share, {})]\n        })\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ? _jsx(MDXLayout, Object.assign({}, props, {\n    children: _jsx(_createMdxContent, props)\n  })) : _createMdxContent(props);\n}\nreturn {\n  default: MDXContent\n};\nfunction _missingMdxReference(id, component) {\n  throw new Error(\"Expected \" + (component ? \"component\" : \"object\") + \" `\" + id + \"` to be defined: you likely forgot to import, pass, or provide it.\");\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"scope":{}},"frontMatter":{}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"lifesavers-poplife"},"buildId":"ARi4wI_ottn-ug_6QdIOX","assetPrefix":"/terminal-escape","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>

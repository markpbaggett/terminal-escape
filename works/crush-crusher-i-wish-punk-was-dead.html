Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 While it&#x27;s sad that CRUSH CRUSHER left us with with just two tapes, we should take the time to celebrate those two tapes, and celebrate one of Oklahoma City&#x27;s truest freak offerings. I Wish Punk Was Dead just sounds like a mess. I Wish Punk Was Dead sounds like wishing punk was dead but knowing you don&#x27;t want to live in a world without punk. Absolute outsiders of the highest order - even (or especially) is this passed you by the first time, I&#x27;m giving you a second chance. This is what it sounds like when you try to fill up emptiness. I WISH PUNK WAS DEAD
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

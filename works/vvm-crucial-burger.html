Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 How was your Thursday? Mine was chill. Well, mostly chill. Went to work (that was less chill) then took the ferry to Angel Island with my mom. Well, we missed that ferry and while we were trying to figure out what to do some lady shouted &quot;anyone else boarding for Tiburon?&quot; and we were like &quot;fuck it&quot; so we went to Tiburon. Walked seven miles or so, went up a few big ass hills, saw some good ass views, passed some stinking rich motherfucking houses and then got on the ferry back to SF. Except the ferry stopped at Angel Island on the way back so I guess we went there after all. Came home, ate some spaghetti, talked for a few hours, cried a bit. You know, regular Thursday shit - how was your Thursday? Mine was chill. Gonna give Friday a shot now, one day at a time style. I suggest listening to V.V.M. today - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m gonna do.CRUCIAL BURGER

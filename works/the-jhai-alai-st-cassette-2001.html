Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 In 1999, WHN? were arranging a tour that would include shows in Australia with Scotland&#x27;s SHANK and shows in several SE Asian countries. On the one hand I&#x27;m glad that it didn&#x27;t happen, because I feel like that might have been the last thing we did (we just weren&#x27;t really gelled as a unit yet) and I wouldn&#x27;t trade the tours we did in the years that followed. But at the same time....man, that shit would have been fucking cool, especially when so many of those scenes were so young and just bursting at the seams with energy (note: they still are). I like to think that we would have played with THE JHAI ALAI in Singapore, because why wouldn&#x27;t a self described Bandana Thrash band from The Bay share a stage with a chaotic blasting screamo band from Lion City? This is the real shit - the MOHINDER, EOTCP, HONEYWELL, HEROIN kind of emo manic with blast beats and strained screams and drawn out guitar driven mania - I would love to see this live....I would have really loved to see it live then. THE JHAI ALAI

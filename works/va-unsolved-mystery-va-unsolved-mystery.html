Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You might think that the television theme song intro track is just a little teaser, but JAMES MICHAEL WILLIAMS is setting the table for a very strange dining experience. From LETTUCE VULTURES to PEPPERMINT TEABAG, from &quot;Bloodshed&quot; to the rousing gospel chorus in &quot;Is God Real?&quot;  (&quot;god might be real but it really doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;), to FOSSIL FUEL&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Of OJ,&quot; Unsolved Mystery is outsider music, non-music, freak music...but it&#x27;s also dark and ominous cuts like the burning electronics like the deadly serious &quot;Our Mother Cries For Us In Hushed Static&quot; by MEMORIALS. Putting PIMP OF PERVERSION and MIKOLAS KUNZ on the same release is....pretty genius. UNSOLVED MYSTERY

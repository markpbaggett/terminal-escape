Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nagoya&#x27;s OUT OF TOUCH predated the wave of retro punk/thrash worship by a solid decade, and this 1991 demo shows them in their most gloriously primitive state. Reinterpreting US punk and hardcore/thrash crossover through Japanese ears, these kids rip through ten killers on their ridiculously limited demo (is 20 copies really a demo? I think it&#x27;s more of a gift for your friends, &#x27;cause no one else is gonna hear that shit). It&#x27;s funny to think of OUT OF TOUCH as kids, but in a Japanese scene dominated by DEMOLITION, RUSTLER, ZONE, NIGHTMARE and DEATHSIDE, OUT OF TOUCH were certainly the newcomers. 18 years after this demo was recorded, the singer served me a delicious vegan picnic in the rain not far from the Nagoya train station...Hidehito is a very nice man.
OUT OF TOUCH

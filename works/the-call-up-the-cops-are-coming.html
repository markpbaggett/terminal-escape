Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 First thought when I popped in the only release from Oakland&#x27;s THE CALL-UP was &quot;Damn...I missed another one.&quot; Whatever I was doing in 2015, I wasn&#x27;t seeing this trio in the flesh, and that was a mistake. Second thought I had when I popped in the only release from Oakland&#x27;s THE CALL-UP was &quot;Damn...this hits me like the first time I heard NEON PISS.&quot; THE CALL-UP were harnessing that energy and those hooks and mixing in UK indie/alt by-way-of AIRFIX KITS...a product of their environment perhaps, but also mayhaps a product of the same influences that led to those other (also great) bands. Eight songs here, more than worthy of a full LP release and packed with infectious, angular, laid back, deliberate punk. Whatever I was doing in 2015, I was clearly fucking up. THE CALL-UP

Second thought I had when I popped in the only release from Oakland's THE CALL-UP was \"Damn...this hits me like the first time I heard NEON PISS.\" THE CALL-UP were harnessing that energy and those hooks and mixing in UK indie/alt by-way-of AIRFIX KITS...a product of their environment perhaps, but also mayhaps a product of the same influences that led to those other (also great) bands. Eight songs here, more than worthy of a full LP release and packed with infectious, angular, laid back, deliberate punk. Whatever I was doing in 2015, I was clearly fucking up. THE CALL-UP\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/terminal-escape/works/the-call-up-the-cops-are-coming","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Call-Up_The-Cops-Are-Coming%2fThe%20Call%20Up%20TE%20mimg_thumb.jpg/full/192,/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":192,"height":73,"alt":"The Call-Up - The Cops Are Coming!"},{"url":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Call-Up_The-Cops-Are-Coming%2fThe%20Call%20Up%20cover%20copy_thumb.jpg/full/125,/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":125,"height":192,"alt":"The Call-Up - The Cops Are Coming!"},{"url":"https://iiif.archive.org/image/iiif/2/The-Call-Up_The-Cops-Are-Coming%2f__ia_thumb.jpg/full/180,/0/default.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","width":180,"height":69,"alt":"The Call-Up - The Cops Are Coming!"}]}},"referencingContent":[],"source":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    h2: \"h2\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components), {Container, Section, Flex, Box, Work, Tabs} = _components;\n  if (!Box) _missingMdxReference(\"Box\", true);\n  if (!Container) _missingMdxReference(\"Container\", true);\n  if (!Flex) _missingMdxReference(\"Flex\", true);\n  if (!Section) _missingMdxReference(\"Section\", true);\n  if (!Tabs) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs\", false);\n  if (!Tabs.Content) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Content\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.List) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.List\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Root) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Root\", true);\n  if (!Tabs.Trigger) _missingMdxReference(\"Tabs.Trigger\", true);\n  if (!Work) _missingMdxReference(\"Work\", false);\n  if (!Work.LinkingProperty) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.LinkingProperty\", true);\n  if (!Work.ManifestId) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ManifestId\", true);\n  if (!Work.Metadata) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Metadata\", true);\n  if (!Work.ReferencingContent) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.ReferencingContent\", true);\n  if (!Work.Related) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Related\", true);\n  if (!Work.RequiredStatement) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.RequiredStatement\", true);\n  if (!Work.Scroll) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Scroll\", true);\n  if (!Work.Share) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Share\", true);\n  if (!Work.Summary) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Summary\", true);\n  if (!Work.Title) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Title\", true);\n  if (!Work.Viewer) _missingMdxReference(\"Work.Viewer\", true);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(Work.Viewer, {}), \"\\n\", _jsxs(Container, {\n      children: [_jsx(Section, {\n        pb: \"4\",\n        children: _jsxs(Flex, {\n          gap: \"7\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Box, {\n            children: [_jsx(Work.Title, {\n              size: \"8\",\n              mb: \"5\"\n            }), _jsx(Work.Summary, {\n              size: \"4\",\n              color: \"gray\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsx(Work.Share, {})]\n        })\n      }), _jsx(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: _jsxs(Tabs.Root, {\n          defaultValue: \"details\",\n          children: [_jsxs(Tabs.List, {\n            children: [_jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: \"Item Details\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: \"Referencing Content\"\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Trigger, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: \"Transcriptions and Translations\"\n            })]\n          }), _jsxs(Box, {\n            pt: \"3\",\n            children: [_jsxs(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"details\",\n              children: [_jsx(Work.Metadata, {}), _jsx(Work.RequiredStatement, {}), _jsx(Work.LinkingProperty, {}), _jsx(Work.ManifestId, {})]\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"annotations\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.Scroll, {})\n            }), _jsx(Tabs.Content, {\n              value: \"essays\",\n              children: _jsx(Work.ReferencingContent, {})\n            })]\n          })]\n        })\n      }), _jsxs(Section, {\n        size: \"1\",\n        children: [_jsx(_components.h2, {\n          children: \"Related Works\"\n        }), _jsx(Work.Related, {})]\n      })]\n    })]\n  });\n}\nfunction MDXContent(props = {}) {\n  const {wrapper: MDXLayout} = Object.assign({}, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return MDXLayout ?

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The &quot;lesser known&quot; CLEVELAND BOUND DEATH SENTENCE is the original CLEVELAND BOUND DEATH SENTENCE, the name taken from an acronym using the first letter of the original members&#x27; names - Casey, Brad, Dave (LOOMIS, SANDBOX), Scott (ALLIGATOR GUN, PROMISE RING, then DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL). Before this 1988 tape, they had added a B (Brendan) a second guitarist (John - hard to squeeze a J-word into that name, I guess), and they were a suburban hardcore machine. From the three second SABBATH rip that starts &quot;The Struggle,&quot; you can just tell you&#x27;re about to get leveled...and you are. Pissed, slightly metallic US hardcore punk with the laid back second wave groove that allowed bands to construct songs (often to their own detriment - some bands are just built for speed). Every track here is a classic - from the guitars that open &quot;Cause Of Death&quot; to the chorus of &quot;Crematorium&quot; C.B.D.S. punch way above their weight from start to finish. Brad&#x27;s vocals deliver a forceful and slightly awkward youthful warble that brings to mind early &#x27;80s Orange County punks while the band bashes out &quot;Afraid&quot; with confidence and power...afraid of nothing. There was a rehearsal tape before this recording, and a decidedly more crossover demo that came after - all are worth visiting, and all are worth far more praise than the band receives. C.B.D.S.And the &quot;other&quot; CLEVELAND BOUND DEATH SENTENCE? Check the logo and the aesthetic on their 1997 EP, and know that one of the founding members spend a lot of time in Milwaukee in the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s. You&#x27;re welcome to draw your own conclusions. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

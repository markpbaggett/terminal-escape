Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punks. When something goes wrong or someone needs help, they just seem to say &quot;let&#x27;s do a benefit.&quot; And as easy as it can be to dismiss this allocation of financial and personal resources (seriously, it&#x27;s really easy), it&#x27;s just as important to recognize the common struggle and speak in a unified voice....even if that voice is straining to be heard over screaming guitars. This compilation was released to raise money for and awareness of refugee Camp de la Liniére in Dunkerque, France during what was then the most heart wrenching public refugee crisis of my adult life. That crisis has now faded into the shadows, shrouded by packed nationless boats in the Mediterranean and unforgivable crimes against family and humanity at the US/Mexican border. So, do we need another compilation cassette? Maybe not, but it helps to know you&#x27;re not alone in your thoughts....and maybe it will help you know that you aren&#x27;t alone in your actions. 
DBEAT THE BORDERS
It&#x27;s worth noting that this comp fukkn screams from start to finish. The bands you recognize on that cover all offer stellar tracks, and some of the bangingest bangers included are from bands that were heretofore unknown to me. Also, I fully recognize what a pass my passport gives me...it&#x27;s a pass that every resident of earth should be afforded. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

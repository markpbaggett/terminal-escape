Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The final full length from &#x27;90s Austrian melodic hardcore band THOSE WHO SURVIVED THE PLAGUE. I would be lying if I said that I loved the whole thing, but the moments that work are plentiful. &quot;Nobody Told Him Fish Can Swim&quot; is some weird bridge between anarcho punk and harDCore, &quot;Die Like A Dog&quot; conjures up SUBMISSION HOLD, and there are countless other moments when I&#x27;m rocked to attention with a &quot;holy shit!&quot; or, even more often, a &quot;whoa - that reminds me of *blank*!&quot; Favorite track for this listener is &quot;New Era,&quot;and there was enough here to make me seek out their earlier recordings...so that&#x27;s a vote in favor. 
A PLAN TO END ALL PLANS

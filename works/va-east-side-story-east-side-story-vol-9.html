Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another compilation of soul baring smoothness from the East Side Story series. There&#x27;s a little more melancholy in this volume, especially with the power-combo of THE GALLAHADS &quot;Lonely Guy&quot; running right into ROSIE &amp; THE ORIGINALS&#x27; tearjerker &quot;Angel Baby&quot; right out of the gate, setting the tone for a monster collection. &quot;I Really Love You&#x27; (DEE DEE SHARP), &quot;Together&quot; (THE INTRUDERS), a little wet funk with &quot;I Love You For All Season&quot; (THE FUZZ), &quot;Me And You&quot; (BRENTON WOOD), plus the brilliant East Side formula that drops main stream standards in the middle of under-the-radar soul shakers. This time it&#x27;s THE PENGUINS&#x27; &quot;Earth Angel&quot; and then RENE &amp; RAY&#x27;s &quot;Queen Of My Heart&quot; leading right into the full production swell of THE INTRUDER&#x27;s &quot;Together&quot; - and they could have ended it there with no complaints, but hang your arm out the side window and feel the warm sun on your face while SAM &amp; BILL belt out &quot;For Your Love&quot; and ROSIE &amp; RON close this volume with &quot;So Dearly.&quot; These comps can truly do no wrong, and vol.9 is perhaps the best yet.  
EAST SIDE STORY vol.9
One of the vocalists on the SAM &amp; BILL track really reminds me of Rio Grande Mud-era Billy Gibbons, which is obviously not a criticism. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I listened to VH as much as any other band in my pre-new wave 1980s - I remember how fucking bummed I was listening to OU812 at a track meet (the only track meet I ever attended - should have called it quits on Van Hagar too, but I digress...). This tape was passed around for years as pre-Van Halen I demos, and while I don&#x27;t actually know the source here (I suspect these recordings are later, but someone else knows and they&#x27;re going to leave a comment and the burning mystery will be solved) I know that I love cranking these rough-ass bass heavy versions of early classics that I have spent a lifetime with. Roth&#x27;s growl in the chorus of &quot;House Of Pain,&quot; Anthony&#x27;s swinging bass in &quot;Woman In Love,&quot; the beginnings of the backing vocals that put a stamp on the band even more than Eddie&#x27;s guitar, a gloriously raw version of &quot;On Fire&quot; and thirteen examples of what an American Hard Rock band is supposed to sound like. Genre defining is one thing....generation defining is something else. DEMO 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

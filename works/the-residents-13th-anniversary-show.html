Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I had a RESIDENTS record when I was in high school - bought it because the eyeballs looked cool and never truly understood what I owned even though I rarely listened to it (probably because I didn&#x27;t understand it). Now I wonder how that record (and a few others I copped when I was a pimply small town adolescent) made it into a shop in Ponca City, Oklahoma but....that&#x27;s a discussion best filed alongside all of the other unsolvable mysteries in my life like &quot;Why can&#x27;t the richest nation-state in history feed and house its citizens?&quot; and &quot;Was my father actually murdered?&quot; As the title suggests, this recording from 1986 celebrates the thirteenth year of THE RESIDENTS, which means they were well established outsiders long before they creeped onto my paltry record shelf a few years later....and it also means that THE RESIDENTS were next level freaks, making music that wasn&#x27;t supposed to make sense to a kid like me in that place and time. I wasn&#x27;t supposed to understand it - I was supposed to be confused and.....curious. Thankfully, I still am. Both.13th ANNIVERSARY SHOW

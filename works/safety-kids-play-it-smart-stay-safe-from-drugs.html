Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Play It Smart has brought me great joy over the years, harnessing every ridiculous &#x27;80s drug paranoia trope and feeding the propaganda to a bunch of child actors is a winning combination in any reality. But in a reality where grown ups&#x27; greatest fear is Gregger getting drugs shoved into his mouth by his &quot;best friend,&quot; Janeen Brady&#x27;s SAFTY KIDS are just a wholesome good time. Brady was a child singer herself, cruising the LDS circuit and singing the Word. She embarked on her own career as a young adult, made a bunch of Mormon babies, and then dropped a series of children&#x27;s records that landed her an invite to Reagan&#x27;s White House because...well, because Nancy. Duh. But with a discography filled with easy listening religious diarrhea, SAFETY KIDS is truly her crowning achievement. Nine uplifting sing alongs with genius skits that follow our pre-pubescent heroes as they navigate the danger and confusion that is a world filled with illegal narcotics. 
PLAY IT SMART: STAY SAFE FROM DRUGS
=================
Why do kids do drugs?
....I don&#x27;t know.
Well, here&#x27;s what I found out: people put chemicals in their bodies because they don&#x27;t like how they are feeling. 
Sometimes, I don&#x27;t like how I feel.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
RALFI PAGÁN&#x27;s version of &quot;Make It With You&quot; is really all vol.6 needs to make it essential - dousing BREAD&#x27;s &#x27;70s schlock with an innocently psychedelic Latin groove was a genius move, and it works even better than it should. The rest of this volume is certainly up to the challenge, of course, from THE WHISPERS doo-wop waltz to JOHNNY FLAMINGO dropping steelpans and inadvertently fuzzed out keys into the summer cruise. THE DELICATES &quot;I Want To Get Married&quot; is another standout, THE DUBS swing hard with &quot;Could This Be Magic&quot; and the ultra smooth &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; from JOHNNY ACE just oozes. This comps are so much more than &quot;oldies&quot; collections (THE MOMENTS&#x27; version of &quot;Love On A Two Way Street&quot; is only eight years older that Never Mind The Bollocks, after all), these are the soulful secret underbelly of the music industry hitmakers that held a death grip on artists and listeners alike...you can hear a little more grit, you can hear a little more desperation, a little more honesty. LITTLE ANTHONY&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m On The Outside Looking In&quot; is a perfect example - it simply must have been too real for radio at the time, so it was relegated to bedroom 45s and late night cruises....and you can practically feel his sigh even (or especially) today. &quot;gotta find a way gotta find a way gotta find a way back to your heart babe....&quot;

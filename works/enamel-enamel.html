Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Another dose of mid-teens USHC that slipped by me in the moment...amazing what you miss out on when you&#x27;re focused on not falling the fuck apart. Philadelphia 2016, nice and squirmy the way the kids liked it back then, but it&#x27;s the way that ENAMEL surge forward that really grabs me. It&#x27;s as if they settle into a tempo and then...the drummer holds them back just enough to feel them try to catch up when he kicks it back up. The bands are completely different, but it&#x27;s the same way I sometimes feel about Markley&#x27;s drumming in ECONOCHRIST - a rock steady four on the floor with a looseness around the pace instead of within it. Most of you are going to notice the vocals, and that&#x27;s okay because they are in your face and full of fire. Some of you are going to pay attention to the guitars instead and that&#x27;s okay too because they are a swarming duo of no bullshit North American hardcore riffs and they are exactly what I need today. But I&#x27;m still gonna hone in on that rhythm section because they&#x27;re giving me pause, they&#x27;re making me think and they&#x27;re making me listen. I guess I should have paid more attention in those twenty teens.ENAMEL

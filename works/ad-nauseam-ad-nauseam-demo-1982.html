Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bands try to manufacture this kind of primal chaos, but the discerning listener can see right through them. AD NAUSEUM, however, were the real deal. The first of several cassette releases, 1982&#x27;s self titled demo is an assault of inept anarcho punk delivered with raw and pure desperation, fighting through tape hiss and a guitar pegged to the right, tracks like &quot;What A State&quot; bang two riffs back and forth like a manic pinball machine. Most of the tape is made up of rudimentary slogs, a verse chorus verse chorus verse chorus stop structure repeated song after song, teenage punk at it&#x27;s absolute finest. Like I said...you can&#x27;t make this shit up, and when it&#x27;s real you know it. 
AD NAUSEUM
The tape includes a ten song session (I have to assume this is a rehearsal recording, because if they paid someone for this then they are either really drunk or really foolish), followed by a 19 song set from March of 1982....as if to prove that the ramshackle performance captured on tape is, in fact, really what AD NAUSEUM delivers. I shared this one a few years back, but after a few loud listens last week and the realization that many pre-2013 links have long passed into the digital ether (yes, I know...no, I won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t fix/replace them all) it seemed that a revisit was a good idea. Cheers to the kids who do shit and who go hard, whether they know how to or not. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

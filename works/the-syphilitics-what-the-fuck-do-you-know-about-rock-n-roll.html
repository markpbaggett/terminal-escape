Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I don&#x27;t need to start an essay about the 1990s, about how the years are misrepresented by punk revisionists. I&#x27;ve certainly blabbed more than enough in these pages to warrant a &#x27;90s Reader that will offer more than my fair share of the collective opinion on the matter, and yet the fact remains....the 1990s USDIY punk scene is far too often dismissed horribly misrepresented. The life and genre defining bands that took advantage of the last gasp of organic scene and sound development, before taste makers (and their tastes) went digital, went warp speed, and some element of free thought and expression was replaced with access and emulation. There are countless lost artifacts from that lost decade, and certainly many of them are from bands trying their hand at this punk thing because of something they saw on cable television instead and not because of a crucial mix tape they got from a pen pal&#x27;s pen pal in Austria who knew about all of the good bands, but this was a time when even those late night no budget music video shows were precious little glimpses into the world that you wanted to touch. Does this mean that every mid-&#x27;90s Ohio artifact is an invaluable piece of punk history....? Probably not. It just means that it was, and somehow that context means something. 
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ROCK &#x27;N ROLL?!!?!??!
Worth noting that the demo pictured is probably from 1994/95, but the band were nice enough to slap the 1996 Centsless Records demo at the end, and those four cuts are way better than the first eight. Killer GG/early-Weasel spit and vinegar with screaming NYC&#x27;77 guitars. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

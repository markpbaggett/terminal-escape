Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
File VIBRATORS along with the scores of starter bands that I never really dug into - and I wonder if the proliferation of access to literally everything means that new/er generations of punk listeners are more (or less) likely to completely skip over the starters. If you can click-click-stream-click your way to CAMERA SILENS and DEEF and COLERA and DEVIATED INSTINCT then maybe you end up skipping over the classics the same way that punk listeners in the &#x27;80s may have eschewed LOVERBOY and NIGHT RANGER. Also, maybe that&#x27;s a shitty analogy, but the point is that VIBRATORS were one of the first, they’ve been consistently cranking out records for 45 years…I don&#x27;t think I could name you a single song aside from “Automatic Lover.” So when several sessions started popping up on live tapes I&#x27;ve been ripping the past few days I figured maybe it was a sign and I paid attention...not surprisingly, the shit is good. I collected a few of those sessions here:Peel Session • January 1977 (choice cut: &quot;Pogo Dancing&quot;)1976 Demos (choice cut: &quot;Young Lust&quot;)1977 Demos (choice cut: &quot;Public Enemy #1&quot; - this session has been given a proper release and is widely available)Like a lot of first wave UK punk the direct connection to bluesy rock &#x27;n roll is front and center, but there&#x27;s a real nice dark almost psychedelic bent to a few tracks here...but punk listeners already know this. Gonna go click-click-stream-click and crank Pure Mania on my way to work today...and appreciate the fact that I will be listening to punk music for the first time until my last breath.VIBRATORS
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

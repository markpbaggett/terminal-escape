Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Anyone else miss out on these NYC screamers when they popped up in the mid-teens? A few years late to the party (as usual), I&#x27;m digging the shit out of some BARBED WIRE at TEHQ lately. Greasy rock &#x27;n roll from a what seems (sounds) bunch of genuine dirtbags - the same way LOST GOAT and DRUNK HORSE kicked our asses 25 years ago by showing us what real rock &#x27;n roll was might sound like in the confines of our warehouse punk bubble. BARBED WIRE are the east coast version - there&#x27;s a lot of Hatchet and Skynyrd in these tunes, the organ often takes the lead....and the leads themselves are freaking deadly. This boy ain&#x27;t complaining one bit. Hear the falsetto at the end of &quot;The Thunderhead&quot; (and &quot;Chrome Lust&quot;), the early AC/DC stomp of &quot;Hellhounds On The Motorway,&quot; the shameless Van Zant (no &quot;D&quot; - if you know what I mean then you know what I mean) strut of &quot;Livin&#x27; And Bleedin&#x27;&quot; - it&#x27;s all here. You might have to suspend a few of your regular requirements, but living requires sacrifice sometimes....at least good livin&#x27; does.BARBED WIRE

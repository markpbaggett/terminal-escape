Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 Sometimes I listen to a band and I think that maybe they&#x27;re a hot fukkn mess live. You know something that I like to see...?  I love watching a hot fukkn mess - and a hot mess bashing the shit out of advanced garage tinged hardcore punk? Well that shit is even better. WERWOLF JONES fit that bill and then some on their first collection of grimy anthemic punk it&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re trying to dumb down great Motor City punk snarls with alcohol and misanthropy but the genius shines through....because a good song is a good fukkn song. Just listen to &quot;Pray For Your Sons&quot; and you&#x27;ll know what I mean.  WEREWOLF JONES

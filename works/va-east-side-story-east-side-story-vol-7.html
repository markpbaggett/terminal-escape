Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The East Side Story series continues raining bombs, starting their seventh volume with GENE CHANDLER&#x27;s instantly recognizable &quot;Duke Of Earl&quot; and running straight into a blissful and almost over produced ballad from BILLY STEWART. A heavier emphasis on the slow crooners this time around; THE STUDENTS - &quot;I&#x27;m So Young,&quot; CHRIS &amp; KATHY - &quot;All You Had To Do Was Tell Me,&quot; THE ORIGINALS &#x27; &quot;Baby, I&#x27;m For Real,&quot; THE SUPERBS - &quot;Baby Baby All The Time&quot; and pretty much everything else on this tape. The prize goes to the soulful swing LINDA THOMAS drops on &quot;Hypnotized&quot; but there&#x27;s not a dud in the mix, twelve more tracks that take you back to a place most of us can only imagine.

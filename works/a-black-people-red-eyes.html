Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dark and brooding sounds for the modern age. Not far from the goth punk explosion, but rooted in punk, and with mature guitar work that would not be out of place on an INTERPOL *gasp* record. In fact, &quot;The Fool&quot; is exactly the kind of track that makes indie bands like that appeal to me, the bands that make me realize that there are fancy pants wearing 20-somethings that were raised on the same sounds that I was, and have taken those sounds into the mainstream world. But then there are songs like &quot;Isolation,&quot; a total punk burner by way of T.S.O.L. or ADOLESCENTS, and then there is the saturated off kilter ambiance of the title track or the COCTEAU TWINS on codeine vibe of &quot;The Hermit&quot; that closes the tape. This is calculated but wholly organic sounding music - unpretentious even though bluntly somber. A BLACK PEOPLE is an even more appropriate name after you spend time with these sounds.
RED EYES

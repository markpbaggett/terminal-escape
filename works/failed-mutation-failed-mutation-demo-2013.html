Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I saw a few bands this summer. If you told me to make a list of the best five, then Milwaukee&#x27;s FAILED MUTATION would be on that list. If you told me to make a list of the best three, then FAILED MUTATION would be on that list too. I could tell you some of the other bands that these kids are (and have been) in, but do you really need me to do that? You shouldn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not gonna lie and say that the demo kick my ass as hard as seeing them live, but band should be better live than recorded...right? This is Midwestern US hardcore punk.
FAILED MUTATION
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I waxed on about the difficulties of describing SHIT FETISH when I dropped off their first demo a few months back. Number Two is easier to get your ears around though...until it isn&#x27;t. A few tracks of deeply damaged hardcore punk with FLIPPER by way of early &#x27;00s DIY punk energy. &quot;1989&quot; opens with starts and stops and tweaked guitars and it&#x27;s almost like EDDY CURRENT mingling with STRAIGHTJACKET NATION (to keep the referenced country-specific). And then....well, and then SHIT FETISH starts to deliver. A raw and punishing hardcore dirge, and mid tempo meat swerve, a piece called &quot;Slakto&quot; that almost hits like some &#x27;60 fuzz rock until it takes a turn and I don&#x27;t even know what kind of freedom I&#x27;m listening to anymore. There&#x27;s just one cut left, and SHIT FETISH saved the.....best? for last with &quot;Nasty Boy.&quot; The recording itself has gotten progressively weirder by this point in the tape, and the guitars are something entirely foreign and unrecognizable which is perfect because this is where the FLIPPER really starts to come out. And then comes the electronics and it all just falls the fuck apart and I&#x27;m just sitting here looking at my cat. Goes without saying that this middle aged Sepo is really looking forward to Demo III to plop. DEMO II
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 I feel like I encountered COUNTY Z at exactly the wrong time (for me). All I wanted then was faster and louder - and I definitely didn&#x27;t want violins. In 1996 I would have eaten this up. Today I listen with intent curiosity. But in 2001...? Nah motherfucker, I wanted blistering drums and sonic tonnage...thankfully these sounds were patient and they waited for me to come around. I&#x27;d file them alongside KREAMY &#x27;LECTIC SANTA, THE EX and SUBMISSION HOLD for fans of outsider experimentation within the loose confines of DIY punk will be at least intrigued (if not enthralled). I still like sonic tonnage though. TRIUMPHANT SONGS OF UTTER DEFEAT

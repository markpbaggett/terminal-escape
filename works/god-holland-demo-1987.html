Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the late &#x27;80s, you had folks who felt like punk (and specifically hardcore) was just completely dead and you had folks who had just moved on and you had folks who were being introduced to new punk-adjacent (or punk influenced) bands without even knowing about the sonic roots. You also had punk and hardcore bands cranking out killer records. GOD cranked out three full lengths around the turn of the decade - way more on the rock and or grunge tip (sign of the times, you know?), but this 1987 recording leans heavier on NYHC and SUICIDAL influences. The transfer is admittedly not the best (tapes, motherfukkr!), but there are some nice rougher versions of some cuts that would appear on the Sweet Life LP, plus &quot;Survival Of The Meek&quot; is a total slammer and doesn&#x27;t seem to pop up anywhere else. GOD - 1987 DEMO
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

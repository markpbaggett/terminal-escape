Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Teenage twerp fury. It&#x27;s as if they are trying to be a raw and nasty hardcore band, but they have the chops of a bunch of knuckle dragging garage teenage pukes. Then again, there are the keyboards, which leads me to believe that this clash of (sub)cultures is anything but an accident. SKULL WITH WINGS comes from 2006 with a bullet, but picture yourself in a Joplin, Missouri teen center in 1994 and these jams will sou d right at home.
SKULL WITH WINGS

Description from Terminal Escape:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the gems I got from Daniel last summer, this DEVASTATION demo has gotten countless plays at TEHQ. Seminal &#x27;80s thrash/death metal from Chicago, these hessians released various versions of a relatively small handful of burners on two demos and self released full length (cassette) during their short existence. Unclear exactly which session this tape is from, since Daniel got it from the band at some point, but you get screaming renditions of &quot;Cranial Hemorrhage&quot; and &quot;Beyond Fear&quot; along with five tracks I couldn&#x27;t positively identify...but I can declare that the (brief) mosh riff in the third (instrumental) track is unfuckwithable. Fretboard gymnastics are next level on all tracks, but DEVASTATION never sacrifice speed or intensity in the process, these dudes are hard as nails and unrelenting throughout. Collections of the demos have been released on CD and there&#x27;s a vinyl box that includes a couple of live sets for the completists. But start here...
DEVASTATION
Definitely recommend listening through to the 0:46 live banter, your patience will be rewarded.
